An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Legislature to thoroughly
review and evaluate the electric
deregulation legislation in order to
ensure that such policy is fair to all
Ohioans.
Whereas, competition in the electric service industry is occurring
across the country and is sought by
regulators and public officials to
begin in Ohio; and
Whereas, such competition will
occur only through the deregulation
of the electric service industry,
which presently operates as a legally mandated monopoly; and
Whereas, deregulation in the electric service industry is being largely encouraged and promoted from
large industry, particularly in northern Ohio where rates for electricity
are the highest in the State and
region; and
Whereas,
competition
through
deregulation is expected to decrease
rates, and promote competition in
the electric industry; and
Whereas, two electric deregulation bills, HB 5 and SB 3, are
presently before the State Legislature, and may pass by June; and
Whereas, many concerned public
officials, groups and individuals
seek electric deregulation legisla-

8
tion that will benefit consumers and
will have a constructive impact on
the environment; and
Whereas, this Council recently
held a public hearing at which citizens and organizations provided
input and identified many issues,
which must be addressed including
the following:
(a) Stranded costs recovery, which
shifts the burden on consumers to
pay the cost for the bad investment
decisions made by Ohio’s electric
utilities.
(b) The impact that deregulation
will have on municipal electric utilities and their ability to compete
with privately operated electric utilities.
(c) Harmful negative impacts that
deregulation could have on the environment.
(d) Potential impact that deregulation may have on low-income
assistance programs.
(e) Impact that deregulation will
have on the taxing structure of electric utilities that could affect the
funding of the school districts and
local government funds.
(f) The affect that transition
charges could have on electric rates
charged to customers in order to
pay for expensive electric power
plants.
Whereas, this Council believes
that it is the responsibility of the
Ohio Legislature to thoroughly review and evaluate the electric deregulation legislation in order to
ensure that such policy is fair to all
Ohioans; now therefore:
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly urges the Ohio Legislature
to thoroughly review and evaluate
the electric deregulation legislation
in order to ensure that it is fair to
all Ohioans and provides for the following:
(a)
Mandated
environmental
improvements in the electric power
industry with coal burning power
plants operating under current pollution control standards.
(b) A substantial percentage of
new energy generation must come
from
environmentally
safe
and
renewable sources such as solar,
wind or fuel cells.
(c) Residential and small business
customers must receive the same
rate relief as larger major business
customers.
(d) Citizens must have an active
input in decisions regarding the
electric power industry.
(e) Maintain the current quality
and reliability of electricity to all
consumers and customers.
(f) Consumer protection provisions to ensure accessibility to the
competitive market and appropriate
education for customers.
(g)
Promotion
of
community
choice through aggregation with an
opt-out provision to ensure consistent services and the lowest competitive price for energy.

Kosovo; and
Whereas, in his capacity as a
responsible national and religious
leader, Reverend Jackson has shown
a tremendous conviction for the
safety of the American soldiers as
he stepped forward to save the lives
of others; and
Whereas,
despite
the
failed
attempts of military and political
leaders to win the release of the soldiers, the Reverend Jackson was
successful in utilizing not a military resolve but a spiritual resolve;
and
Whereas,
Councilman
Patmon
from Cleveland’s Eighth Ward and
the residents of that said Ward are
proud to have named a street after
the Reverend Jesse Jackson. Cleveland is believed to be the only major
American city to name a street after
him for dedicating his life for the
betterment of mankind and the spiritual growth and development of the
world’s communities; and
Whereas, the Reverend Jackson
is a loving spiritual messenger,
father, husband and living legend
and role model for our youth; now,
therefore.
Be it resolved, that this Council
does hereby recognize and congratulate the Honorable Jesse Lewis
Jackson for all his accomplishments
throughout his career, but especially for his most recent accomplishment in securing the release of
three young soldiers in a non-violent
manner-without the need of guns,
bombs and/or tanks.
Be it further resolved, that the
Clerk of Council be and she is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this Resolution of Congratulations
to Councilman Bill W. Patmon for
proper presentation.

a proposed design in part if the Board finds that only that part meets the requirements of this section. However, when in the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, the proposed corner fence will not block lines of sight

she shall issue a permit for such corner fence provided that the fence shall not exceed fifty-four inches.

where not so permitted, gasoline pump islands, sign poles or similar temporary and easily removable structures,
provided that conditional and temporary permits therefor are granted, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards by the Board after public notice and public hearing, and provided, further, that the erection, maintenance
and use thereof do not conflict with the intent and purposes of this Zoning Code.

Zoning Code, the following rear yard and interior side yard encroachments shall be permitted in any use district:

a
reasonable
opportunity for all interested parties to express their opinions under
such rules as the Commission may

date and shall notify any owner or
any person having a legal or equitable interest in the property, as
