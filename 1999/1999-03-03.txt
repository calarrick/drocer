FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 340-99.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
HUD to demolish the Belvoir-Cliffs
apartment building and to grant
title to the property to the City of
Cleveland for compatible neighborhood development.
Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) owns the Belvoir-Cliffs, a 160
unit apartment building, located at
the intersection of Belvoir Blvd. and
Cliffview Road in the Euclid Park
community of the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, HUD was forced to
assume ownership and control of the
building because its previous owner
let the property fall into severe disrepair, as evidenced by numerous
significant code violations and its
very low occupancy rate; and
Whereas, Belvoir-Cliffs has become a haven for illegal drug activities and prostitution, presenting a
profound safety risk to the surrounding neighborhood; and
Whereas, the configuration of
the buildings lacks recreational
and structural amenities and presents a barracks-like appearance,
detracting
from
the
aesthetic
appearance of the neighborhood
and making it markedly different
from the surrounding ranch-style
houses; and
Whereas, the citizens of the community, in the interest of safety and
well-being
of
the
neighborhood,
have expressed their desire to have
the facility demolished, as opposed
to HUD performing a cosmetic alteration of the apartment building;
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges HUD to act
in the best interest of the residents
of the City of Cleveland and to
demolish the Belvoir-Cliffs apartment building, as it unsafe and
undesirable for low income housing.
Section 2. That, upon demolition of
Belvoir-Cliffs, HUD grant title to the
property to the City of Cleveland so
that it may be developed in a use
that is compatible with and meets
the needs of the surrounding community.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this Resolution to Andrew
Cuomo, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; Mayor Michael White; and
Linda Hudecek, Director of Community Development.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Lakeview
Superette, 970 Lakeview Rd., Cleveland, Ohio 44108; and
Whereas, the granting of this

already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not qualify to be a permit holder and/or has
demonstrated that he has operated his
liquor business in disregard of the
laws, regulations or local ordinances of
this state or any other state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

immediately upon its adoption and

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 231-99.
By Councilmen Cintron, Jones,
Westbrook, Sweeney, Rybka, Polensek, Coats, Robinson, Gordon, Johnson and Melena.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor of the City of Cleveland,
and Municipal Court Judges and the
City Prosecutor to consider creating
a City of Cleveland House Arrest
Program for those individuals who
have
committed
nonviolent
and
minor misdemeanor offenses with
the exception of drug and sexual
offenders in order to reduce overcrowded conditions in Cleveland
City Jails.
Whereas, there is a severe problem of overcrowded conditions at
the Cleveland Workhouse, and local
city jails, especially during weekends, holidays and summer months
which often creates an unsafe environment for both inmates and correctional guards that increases the
threat to their health and safety;
and
Whereas, nonviolent and minor
misdemeanant offenders are often
sharing the same correctional facility with major felons and violent
criminals, which places their safety
at risk; and
Whereas, overcrowded jail conditions places an additional burden on
correctional officials to maintain
control and safety in such a large
population that is confined in a limited enclosed physical environment;
and
Whereas, a House Arrest Program
can help alleviate overcrowded jail
conditions by placing non-violent
and minor misdemeanant offenders
under specialized electronic monitoring, which restricts the offender’s
freedom of movement within the
community; and
Whereas, this program will enable
the community to incarcerate more
violent criminals in City correctional facilities, since there will be more
space available to confine them due
to
placing
nonviolent
offenders
under specialized electronic House
Arrest supervision; and
Whereas, a House Arrest Program
with electronic monitoring increases
supervision of convicted offenders,
reduces jail overcrowding and saves
taxpayers expenses; and

Whereas, many other communities
throughout the United States effectively utilize this particular program in order to ease prison overcrowding; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly supports
the creation of a House Arrest Program in order to reduce jail overcrowding and to place nonviolent
and minor misdemeanant offenders
under specialized electronic supervision that closely monitors their
activities while serving out their
sentence within the confinement of
their home.
Section 2. That the House Arrest
Program allows such offenders to
maintain full-time employment or to
participate in rehabilitative services
thus enabling them to remain a productive member of the community
while being under close electronic
supervision by local correctional
authorities.
Section 3. That the House Arrest
Program enables the offender to
remain a productive member of the
community while being under close
electronic supervision by the local
authorities in a restricted home
environment.
Section 4. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly urges the
Mayor of the City of Cleveland, and
Municipal Court Judges and the City
Prosecutors to consider creating a
House Arrest Program for nonviolent
and
minor
misdemeanant
offenders in order to reduce the jail
population and expenses to the taxpayer.
Section 5. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit a certified copy of this resolution to the Mayor of the City of
Cleveland and to the presiding
Administrative Judge of the Cleveland Municipal Court, and City Prosecutor.
Section 6. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted February 22, 1999.
Effective March 3, 1999.
Res. No. 233-99.
By Councilman Willis.
An emergency resolution urging
the City’s Department of Community Development, the Director of City
Planning, the Chair of the City Planning Commission and the Cleveland
Landmarks Commission to seek designation of Hazeldell School as a
historical landmark.
Whereas, Hazeldell School, located at 654 East 123rd Street in the
City of Cleveland, was constructed
beginning in 1900 and reflects the
work of notable craftsmanship; and
Whereas, Hazeldell School consists of three primary elements, the
original 1900 school and 2 later
annexes built in 1910 and 1915, with
such annexes being designed by
noted architect Frank Seymour Barnum; and
Whereas, Hazeldell School is a
significant
historical
structure
because
it
demonstrates
the
advances and changes in American
elementary
education
from
1900
through 1947; and

Whereas, in passing Codified Ordinance 161.01, the Council of the City
of Cleveland declared as a matter of
public policy that the preservation,
protection,
and
perpetuation
of
buildings and structures having a
special historical, community or aesthetic interest or value is a public
necessity and is in the interest of
the people; and
Whereas,
the
Cleveland
Landmarks Commission, working in conjunction with the City Planning
Commission, may designate structures of historical and architectural
significance as a landmark; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio may
also designate a structure as a historical landmark; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Chair of
the Cleveland Landmarks Commission, the Director of City Planning
and the Chair of the City Planning
Commission to recognize the historical and architectural significance
of Hazeldell School and to pursue
the designation of Hazeldell School
as a City landmark in accordance
with Chapter 161 of the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Director of
Community Development is requested to pursue the designation of
Hazeldell School as a historic landmark by the State of Ohio.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is requested to transmit a copy
of this Resolution to Linda Hudecek,
Director
of
Community
Development; Hunter Morrison, Director of
the City Planning; Anthony Coyne,
Acting Chair of the City Planning
Commission; and Richard Schanfarber, Chair of the Cleveland Landmarks Commission.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted February 22, 1999.
Effective March 3, 1999, without
the signature of the Mayor.
