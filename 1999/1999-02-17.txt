ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 152-99.
By Councilmen Willis and Cintron.
An emergency resolution urging
the Regional Transit Authority to
continue usage of buses fueled by
compressed natural gas and to conduct further studies prior to purchasing diesel powered vehicles.
Whereas, the Regional Transit
Authority (RTA) buses provide service to thousands of passengers in
and around the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, in a progressive effort
to ensure a cleaner environment,
RTA became a leader in the transit
industry by purchasing and using
buses powered by natural gas, as
opposed to diesel buses; and
Whereas, diesel powered buses
release a greater number of carcinogenic particulates than buses
powered by CNG; and
Whereas, RTA currently has 166
buses, or 22 percent of its fleet,
which are powered by compressed
natural gas (CNG); and
Whereas, RTA is considering the
suspension of purchase and use of
CNG powered buses in favor of
increased use of diesel buses; and
Whereas, discontinuance of buses
fueled by CNG would adversely
impact the air quality of the City of
Cleveland
and
could
negatively
impair the health of the residents of
our neighborhoods; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the

Res. No. 153-99.
By Councilmen Cimperman, Westbrook, ~Sweeney and Cintron.
An emergency resolution urging
Giant Eagle to continue the surplus
food donation policy established by

Whereas, Riser Foods and Stop-NShop Supermarkets established a

whereby surplus food that is appropriate for distribution is made available to agencies that feed the hungry in Cleveland and Northeast
Ohio; and
Whereas, food that would otherwise be wasted is provided to hungry men, women and children; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland strongly encourages

policy; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly encourages Giant Eagle to continue the

shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 198-99.
By Councilman Rybka.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the renewal of
a C1 and C2 Liquor Permit to 4464

No. 1508-98, adopted August 19, 1998;
and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.
Res. No. 199-99.
By Councilman Lewis.
An emergency resolution urging
the utility companies to discontinue
certain collection practices in regard
to HEAP participants.
Whereas, as the Home Energy
Assistance Program (HEAP) is a
federally funded program administered by the State of Ohio designed
to help eligible low-income Ohioans
meet the high costs of home heating; and
Whereas, the members of Cleveland City Council have received a
number of complaints from HEAP
participants regarding the utility
companies referral of them to collection agencies, threat of foreclosure
and other aggressive practices, and
Whereas, HEAP was not intended
to cause such results and it being
in the best interest of the City that
these
issues
be
addressed
and
resolved; and
Whereas, a meeting between representative(s) of the utility companies and members of Cleveland City
Council to discuss these issues
would help to resolve these issues
for the benefit of the general public; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges

By Councilman Willis.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor and his staff to join with
other governmental entities for the

at a decreased rate.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
through the Department of Finance,
purchases natural gas and contracts
for the purchase of natural gas
transportation from East Ohio Gas
Company on an annual or biannual
basis; and
Whereas, East Ohio Gas is the
sole provider of natural gas for
Cleveland; and

Whereas, since 1997, the City of
Cleveland has utilized the services
of a broker in order to purchase natural gas at a decreased rate, rather
than purchasing natural gas directly from East Ohio Gas; and
Whereas, it may be possible for
the City of Cleveland to realize a
greater cost savings if other governmental entities in and around the
City would work in a collaborative
manner with the City to purchase
natural gas; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Directors of Finance and Public Utilities
to examine the possibility of the
