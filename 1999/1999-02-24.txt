FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 231-99.
By Councilmen Cintron, Jones,
Westbrook, Sweeney, Rybka, Polensek, Coats, Robinson, Gordon, Johnson and Melena.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor of the City of Cleveland,
and Municipal Court Judges and the
City Prosecutor to consider creating
a City of Cleveland House Arrest
Program for those individuals who
have
committed
nonviolent
and
minor misdemeanor offenses with
the exception of drug and sexual
offenders in order to reduce overcrowded conditions in Cleveland
City Jails.
Whereas, there is a severe problem of overcrowded conditions at
the Cleveland Workhouse, and local
city jails, especially during weekends, holidays and summer months
which often creates an unsafe environment for both inmates and correctional guards that increases the
threat to their health and safety;
and
Whereas, nonviolent and minor
misdemeanant offenders are often
sharing the same correctional facility with major felons and violent
criminals, which places their safety
at risk; and
Whereas, overcrowded jail conditions places an additional burden on
correctional officials to maintain
control and safety in such a large
population that is confined in a limited enclosed physical environment;
and
Whereas, a House Arrest Program
can help alleviate overcrowded jail
conditions by placing non-violent
and minor misdemeanant offenders
under specialized electronic monitoring, which restricts the offender’s
freedom of movement within the
community; and
Whereas, this program will enable
the community to incarcerate more
violent criminals in City correctional facilities, since there will be more
space available to confine them due
to
placing
nonviolent
offenders
under specialized electronic House
Arrest supervision; and
Whereas, a House Arrest Program
with electronic monitoring increases
supervision of convicted offenders,
reduces jail overcrowding and saves
taxpayers expenses; and
Whereas, many other communities
throughout the United States effectively utilize this particular program in order to ease prison overcrowding; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly supports
the creation of a House Arrest Program in order to reduce jail overcrowding and to place nonviolent
and minor misdemeanant offenders
under specialized electronic supervision that closely monitors their
activities while serving out their
sentence within the confinement of
their home.
Section 2. That the House Arrest
Program allows such offenders to
maintain full-time employment or to
participate in rehabilitative services
thus enabling them to remain a productive member of the community
while being under close electronic
supervision by local correctional
authorities.
Section 3. That the House Arrest
Program enables the offender to
remain a productive member of the

community while being under close
electronic supervision by the local
authorities in a restricted home
environment.
Section 4. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly urges the
Mayor of the City of Cleveland, and
Municipal Court Judges and the City
Prosecutors to consider creating a
House Arrest Program for nonviolent
and
minor
misdemeanant
offenders in order to reduce the jail
population and expenses to the taxpayer.
Section 5. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit a certified copy of this resolution to the Mayor of the City of
Cleveland and to the presiding
Administrative Judge of the Cleveland Municipal Court, and City Prosecutor.
Section 6. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it

Res. No. 233-99.
By Councilman Willis.
An emergency resolution urging
the City’s Department of Community Development, the Director of City
Planning, the Chair of the City Planning Commission and the Cleveland
Landmarks Commission to seek designation of Hazeldell School as a
historical landmark.
Whereas, Hazeldell School, located at 654 East 123rd Street in the
City of Cleveland, was constructed
beginning in 1900 and reflects the
work of notable craftsmanship; and
Whereas, Hazeldell School consists of three primary elements, the
original 1900 school and 2 later
annexes built in 1910 and 1915, with
such annexes being designed by
noted architect Frank Seymour Barnum; and
Whereas, Hazeldell School is a
significant
historical
structure
because
it
demonstrates
the
advances and changes in American
elementary
education
from
1900
through 1947; and
Whereas, in passing Codified Ordinance 161.01, the Council of the City
of Cleveland declared as a matter of
public policy that the preservation,
protection,
and
perpetuation
of
buildings and structures having a
special historical, community or aesthetic interest or value is a public
necessity and is in the interest of
the people; and
Whereas,
the
Cleveland
Landmarks Commission, working in conjunction with the City Planning
Commission, may designate structures of historical and architectural
significance as a landmark; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio may
also designate a structure as a historical landmark; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Chair of
the Cleveland Landmarks Commission, the Director of City Planning
and the Chair of the City Planning

Ohio
Gas
Company
at
a
decreased rate.
