September 22, 1999
tial for businesses to operate properly and for employees to work to
their fullest potential; and
Whereas, Council has, by passage
of numerous resolutions, recognized
the right of employees to seek safe,
fair and productive working conditions and to be paid equitably for
their hard work; and
Whereas, Council recognizes the
right of workers to organize free
from interference, intimidation and
retribution; and
Whereas, approximately 250 workers at the SuperTrapp, and DCM,
subsidiaries of Dreison Industries,
voted to be represented by the
UNITE union and that such election
was upheld by the National Labor
Relations Board; and
Whereas, SuperTrapp and DCM
have failed to comply with the NLRB
order and have acted adversely to
workers active with the union; and
Whereas, workers, frustrated by
the lack of management’s recognition of UNITE, have walked off the
job; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges SuperTrapp
and DCM, subsidiaries of Dreison
Industries, to comply with the order
of the NLRB and to act in accordance with applicable laws in its

An emergency resolution urging
Congress to adopt legislation to
ensure the provisions of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965 remain in place
permanently.
Whereas, the 15th amendment to
the United States Constitution prohibits racial discrimination in voting; and
Whereas, to ensure that this constitutional requirement was upheld,
Congress enacted the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 to address the widespread discrimination that existed
in many areas of the country where
African Americans were not permitted to vote, and those who registered to vote or assisted in registering others to vote risked losing
their jobs, their homes and even
their lives; and
Whereas, the Voting Rights Act of
1965 provided, among other things,
for federal registrars to register voters in certain areas, federal monitors for elections, and prohibited the
creation of voting procedures that
were racially discriminatory; and
Whereas, the provisions of the
Voting Rights Act were extended in

The City Record
1970, 1975 and 1982 and are now
scheduled to expire in 2007, if not
further extended; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland abhors racial discrimination in all forms, and particularly with respect to the ability to vote
since that right is the cornerstone
of our democracy; and
Whereas, the United States Congress should enact a measure that
ensures that the mechanisms to
monitor discrimination in voting
established by the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 will remain in effect permanently; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges Congress to
enact legislation that will ensure
that the procedures to monitor and
prevent discrimination in voting
established by the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 will remain in effect permanently, and not be subject to periodic review by Congress.

An emergency resolution urging
the Senate and the President of the
United States to enact the African
Growth and Opportunity Act, S. 1387,
creating a new trade and investment policy for sub-Sahara Africa.
Whereas, stable trade relations
between nations provide economic,
political and social benefits for the
residents of both countries; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland believes that it is in
the mutual interest of the United
States and sub-Sahara Africa to
encourage and promote the economic growth of sub-Sahara Africa
through the creation of trade and
investment policies; and
Whereas, the United States Senate
is currently considering the African
Growth and Opportunity Act, S. 1387,
that would support economic selfreliance of sub-Saharan countries
that are committed to accountable
government, economic reform and
the eradication of poverty; and
Whereas, the enactment of this
act would introduce U.S. businesses
and investors to the immense trade
and
investment
opportunities
throughout sub-Saharan Africa and
provide African businesses with
increased access to technology, management expertise and financial
resources; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Senate
and the President of United States

An emergency resolution urging
tho U. S. Congress to investigate
HUD’s handling of Longwood and
Rainbow Apartments; and demanding that HUD meet its agreement
and promise to the tenants of Longwood and Rainbow Apartments by
not displacing them with Section 8
vouchers; that HUD bring in new
owners to maintain the properties;
and that HUD help develop and find
a long range plan for the renovation
of both properties.
Whereas, Longwood Apartments
is the home of over 800 families and
Rainbow Apartments is the home of
over 400 families; and
Whereas, the families in Longwood and Rainbow Apartments are
poor families; and
Whereas, there is a great demand
for housing opportunities such as
that provided by Longwood and
Rainbow Apartments; and
Whereas,
both
properties
are
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) subsidized properties; and
Whereas, HUD is required to
ensure safe, sanitary and decent
housing when subsidizing housing;
and
Whereas, the condition of Longwood and Rainbow Apartments has
been below housing quality standards (HQS) for many years; and
Whereas, HUD knew that both
properties were below housing quality standards, but nevertheless continued to pay management fees and
subsidies to the owners of Longwood and Rainbow Apartments; and
Whereas,
both
properties
are
owned by the same company; and
Whereas, local advocates and tenants of Longwood and Rainbow Apartments have for years complained to
HUD about substandard conditions
existing at both properties; and
Whereas, HUD had full knowledge of the substandard conditions
while continuing to pay management fees and subsidies; and
Whereas, when the tenants of
Longwood and Rainbow Apartments
held a news conference in 1997 and
exposed to the general public the
substandard living conditions, and
the City of Cleveland sighted both
properties with a total of 8,000 code
violations, then and only then, did
HUD question the owners; and
Whereas, HUD’s solution was to
foreclose on Longwood and Rainbow
Apartments and give over 1,200 families Section 8 vouchers; and
Whereas, tenants, advocates and

30
government officials such as former
Congressman Louis Stokes, Mayor
Michael White and the entire Cleveland City Council opposed HUD’s
proposed solution; and
Whereas, Resolution No. 1705-98
was passed unanimously by Cleveland City Council outlining its objections to HUD’s plan; and
Whereas,
HUD
subsequently
agreed not to use Section 8 vouchers and not to foreclose on Longwood and Rainbow Apartments; and
Whereas, HUD further agreed to
require the owner to sell its interest
in both properties; and
Whereas, Fannie Mae, as a limited partner at Longwood, removed its
operating partner and replaced them
with the Finch Group; and
Whereas, this new partnership
was approved by HUD; and
Whereas, HUD agreed with the
Finch Group that the mortgage at
Longwood would not be paid and
that the mortgage portion of the
subsidy would go toward emergency
repairs and correcting the code violations; and
Whereas, HUD also agreed the
Finch Group would develop a long
range plan for the complete renovation of Longwood Apartments; and
Whereas, HUD participated in
developing the long range plan; and
Whereas, HUD agreed to pay for
the implementation of the long
range plan with financial assistance
from the owners and state and local
governments; and
Whereas, before the agreed upon
process is completed, HUD now
wants to renege on its agreement by
declaring a default, to foreclose on
Longwood, to give over 800 families
Section 8 vouchers, and to demolish
Longwood; and
Whereas, HUD again has broken
its promise to tenants, advocated
and government officials; and
Whereas, HUD has a written
agreement with the owners of Rainbow Apartments to sell its interest
in Rainbow; and
Whereas, HUD agreed to give the
owners of Rainbow Apartments $1.6
million for selling its interest; and
Whereas, HUD gave the owners at
least two extensions on the agreement but no sale has taken place;
and
Whereas, HUD continues to pay
the owners of Rainbow Apartments
management fees and subsidies; and
Whereas, there is no work on the
grounds, common areas, and apartments by the owners; and
Whereas, the tenants at Rainbow
Apartments have given notice to the
owners of a rent strike if maintenance issues are not addressed; and
Whereas, HUD has full knowledge
of the conditions and the proposed
rent strike, but continues to give the
owners managements fees and subsidies; and
Whereas, HUD treats the owner of
Rainbow, who is the former owner
at Longwood, in a way that continues to make it profitable for them
to maintain substandard housing,
while at the same time, threatening
the loss of homes for over 800 families at Longwood through foreclosure; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is deeply concerned
about HUD’s practices at Longwood
and
Rainbow
Apartments
and
requests that there be an investigation of HUD’s practices at these
properties; now, therefore,

The City Record

By Councilman Zone.
An emergency resolution encouraging Cleveland’s EMS and area
hospitals to develop, publicize and
adhere to strict guidelines for transporting stroke victims to designated
stroke treatment centers.
Whereas,
according
to
the
Health Systems Agency of North
Central Ohio, strokes are the third
highest cause of death regionally,
following heart disease and cancer; and

The City Record
Whereas, from 1992 through 1996,
residents of Cuyahoga County experienced a death rate due to stroke
of 27.3 per 100,000 population, with
a higher rate of 39.2 deaths experienced by African Americans; and
Whereas, residents of the City of
Cleveland died from a stroke at a
rate of 33.5 per 100,000 population in
1996; and
Whereas, many of these deaths
could be eliminated and the medical
complications arising from strokes
could be eliminated with use of a clot
dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), and associated neurological treatment; and
Whereas, since TPA must be
administered within three hours of
the onset of symptoms to provide
benefit to the patient, it is imperative for EMS and medical services
providers to act quickly; and
Whereas, in 1997, the National
Institutes of Health proposed the
following guidelines for sites that
seek
to
care
for
acute
stroke
patients: 1) The patient must be
seen within 10 minutes of arrival; 2)
Cranial CT scanning should be started within 25 minutes; 3) Interpretation of the CT scan by an individual trained in images associated
with acute stroke has to be done
within 45 minutes; and 4) Intravenous TPA, if appropriate, should
be administered within 60 minutes
of arrival; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland is greatly concerned
with the health, safety and welfare
of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, the Council encourages
Cleveland’s EMS and area hospitals
to develop, publicize and adhere to
strict guidelines for transporting
stroke victims to designated stroke
treatment centers that meet the criteria set forth by the National Institutes of Health; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland believes that all
residents of the City of Cleveland
are entitled to receive quality medical health care and encourages the
City’s Division of Emergency Medical Services to work with area hospitals to develop, publicize and
adhere to a policy of transporting
stroke victims to facilities that use
TPA and associated neurological
treatment in accordance with the
guidelines of the National Institutes
of Health. EMS is urged to solicit
health care plans from area hospitals and to review the performance
of those plans to ensure that residents suffering strokes are receiving the best care possible.

a copy of this resolution to the following: Mayor Michael White; Bruce
Shade, Commissioner of Emergency
Medical Services; and Nancy Roth,
Executive Director of HSANCO.
