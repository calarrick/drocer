Patmon, Lewis, Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to reject
House Bill 283 concerning the regulation of fees charged by municipalities for the use of public rights
of way by utility companies.
Whereas, municipalities such as
the City of Cleveland have certain
constitutional rights and obligations
to control the activities of and contract with public utilities within
their jurisdictions; and
Whereas, many cases in the Ohio
Supreme Court and other jurisdictions have recognized the right of
governmental entities to charge for
the use of rights of way; and
Whereas, an amendment to Ohio
House Bill 283 has been proposed
which would prohibit a municipality in the State of Ohio from levying
a tax, fee or charge for the right or
privilege of using or occupying a
public way for purposes of delivering natural gas, electric, telecommunication or cable television services; and
Whereas, public rights of way are
valuable property rights and generate certain revenue for the City
of Cleveland, and are fees which
utility companies can well afford;
and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is opposed to Ohio
House Bill 283 and further has great
concern about the constitutionality
of such measure; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the mem-

1299

11
bers of the Ohio General Assembly
to oppose House Bill 283 which prohibits municipalities from charging
fees for the use of rights of way by
various public utilities, communication providers and cable television
companies.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this resolution to JoAnn
Davidson, Speaker of the House;
Roy L. Ray, Chair of the Ohio Senate Finance Committee; and all
Cleveland area State Representatives.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted June 14, 1999.
Effective June 17, 1999.

Res. No. 1176-99.
By Councilmen Jones, Westbrook,
Cimperman and Gordon.
An emergency resolution urging
the Governor of Ohio to implement
the waiver of a provision in the federal welfare law limiting single,
childless, unemployed workers to only
3 months of food stamps every 3
years for those areas of Ohio (including Cleveland and East Cleveland)
that have been deemed surplus labor
areas by the U.S. Department of
Labor.
Whereas, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, commonly
referred to as the “welfare reform”
law, has made changes in this
nation’s social safety net, which significantly affects the food stamp
program; and
Whereas, the United States Congress determined and decided as
part of the welfare reform effort
that anyone between the ages of 1850, with no dependents, and not eligible for disability assistance under
either the Social Security or Supplemental Security Income programs
should not be able to receive food
stamps except in a dire emergency;
and
Whereas, these recipients were
disqualified
from
receiving
food
stamps except for three months out
of any three-year period, and who are
generally not eligible for any other
program of public assistance; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Department
of
Employment
and
Entitlement Services had estimated
that 12,882 people residing in Cuyahoga County are at risk of losing
food stamp benefits because they
are between the ages of 18-50, and
have no dependents; and
Whereas, the County estimates
that 86% of the at risk group
resides in Cleveland and East Cleveland, which translates to an annual
benefit loss of $10.2 million per year;
and
Whereas, the Ohio Legislative
Budget Office estimates the cost of
implementing the Food Stamp Time
Limit Waiver will cost the state
administration merely $36,000 per
year, which amounts to less than
one-third of one percent of the estimated federal food benefits to eligible citizens in this county; and

12
Whereas, there is a significant
number of individuals in this at-risk
population with disabilities that are
not quite severe enough to qualify
for the federal disability programs,
but nevertheless have a very difficult time finding and retaining
employment; and
Whereas, many of these recipients
whose benefits have been cut will
seek assistance from food hunger
centers, which will place an additional strain such centers that provide food to the needy; and
Whereas, the federal government
has initiated a waiver provision in
the welfare law in those areas that
have a high unemployment rate,
which allows those recipients to
receive
benefits
who
otherwise
would be taken off; and
Whereas, the former Ohio Governor George Voinovich applied for
and was granted the federal waiver
for Cleveland and East Cleveland
within Cuyahoga County and all
areas of high unemployment in the
State of Ohio, and
Whereas, the former Governor
Voinovich decided not to implement
the waiver, thereby eliminating food
stamp benefits of those individuals
who are at most risk, and thereby
placing tremendous obstacles and
burdens placed on them during the
transition from welfare to work; and
Whereas, such implementation of
the food stamp waiver program
could provide $10 million dollars to
the local economy, and provide
social service and other human service organizations a more reasonable amount of time to develop a
comprehensive work program for
recipients, including public/private
partnership programs; now therefore:
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly
urges
Ohio
Governor
Robert Taft to consider implementing the food stamp waiver provision
in order to reduce the additional
hardships that will be encountered
by those recipients who have lost
their benefits.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
strongly
urges
Ohio
Governor
Robert Taft to consider application
and implementation of this waiver
provision in order to prevent any
recipient from losing welfare benefits, and to work closely with Cuyahoga County and the City of Cleveland to find work opportunities for
those recipients who are not covered
by the waiver.
Section
3.
That
this
Council
invites Governor Taft to Cleveland
for a tour of hunger facilities, and
a presentation by local officials and
service providers about the potential
impact of the Food Stamp Time
Limit Waiver in this community.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby be directed to
transmit a certified copy of this resolution to Ohio Governor Robert
Taft and the Greater Cleveland Committee on Hunger.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

The City Record
Memorandum of Understanding with
Fairview Hospital relative to its
Expansion Plan and implementation
of its Campus Plan.
Section 2. That the Memorandum
of Understanding authorized by Section 1 of this ordinance shall be substantially in the form as follows:
MEMORANDUM
of
UNDERSTANDING
between
THE CITY OF CLEVELAND
and
FAIRVIEW HOSPITAL
This Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) is entered this _____
day of _____, 1999, by and between
the City of Cleveland (“City”), a
municipal corporation of the State of
Ohio, by and through Michael R.
White, Mayor and Fairview General
Hospital
(“FH”),
18101
Lorain
Avenue, by and through its President.
RECITALS:
1. FH has operated a hospital in
the West Park neighborhood of the
City of Cleveland since 1955. FH
desires to modernize and expand its
facility by constructing and operating the ParkView Patient Care Center, a 171,000 square foot facility
linked to the existing hospital facility (“FH Expansion Project”).
2. Due to the FH Expansion Project, growth of the hospital, and
other neighborhood concerns, additional parking and roadway reconfigurations are necessary. Such FH
Expansion Project and neighborhood concerns have been addressed
in a comprehensive plan (“Campus
Plan”), developed by the hospital
with consultation from the community; and accepted by the Cleveland
City Planning Commission by Resolution No. 98-1106 on November 6,
1998. The Campus Plan, attached
hereto as Exhibit A, maximizes use
of hospital owned property, while at
the same time buffering adjacent
neighborhoods — thereby increasing
homes values and improving the
quality of life in the neighborhood
by eliminating nonresidential traffic. The Campus Plan also relieves
the burden placed on the municipal
parking facility at Kamms Corner
by hospital employees.
3. In order to implement the Campus Plan, the parties have made certain pledges concerning the issues
of zoning, traffic circulation and
parking.
4. The City of Cleveland and FH
desire to set forth below the understanding that has been reached relative to the implementation of the
Campus Plan; it is the intention of
the parties to seek the appropriate
legislation necessary to satisfy the
agreements and pledges set forth
herein.
In consideration of the foregoing
and the mutual promises contained
herein, the parties hereto agree as
follows:
1.
Residential
Parcel
Acquisitions. FH will acquire two residential parcels, located at the corner
of Riverside Road and Fernshaw
Avenue, known as Permanent Parcel Nos. 026-02-024 and 026-02-026, at
fair market value. FH shall relocate or remove all structures on the

1313

25
property necessary for the construction of a cul-de-sac at the
westerly terminus
of
Fernshaw
Avenue and shall offer to convey
to the City such portions of the
parcels as may be necessary for
the cul-de-sac as discussed in paragraph 2 herein. Title to all portions
of PPNs. 026-02-024 and 026-02-026
not needed for the construction and
maintenance
of
the
cul-de-sacs
shall be transferred to the City of
Cleveland’s Land Bank and; FH
shall ensure that the garage of
PPN. 026-02-024 remains intact and
is conveyed to the City. All real
property transfers to the City are
subject to legislation accepting the
property.
2. Cul-de-sacs. FH shall construct
a cul-de-sac, at their sole expense, at
the westerly terminus of Fernshaw
Avenue and shall construct, at their
sole expense, a cul-de-sac at the
northerly terminus of Riveredge
Road. Construction of the cul-de-sacs
shall commence immediately upon
receipt of the necessary City permits, which shall be obtained within 60 days of acquisition of the property, unless delayed by the City;
shall be completed no later than 60
days following commencement of
construction; shall be in conformance with all City requirements;
and shall conform with the Campus
Plan in all respects.
3. Parking Facility. FH, immediately upon receipt of the necessary
permits from the City, shall immediately expand the existing parking lot on FH property along
Riveredge Road to a total of 400
spaces, inclusive of the spaces within the existing lot. The parties
acknowledge that, subsequent to
2001, FH may seek to expand the
Parking Facility by an additional
400 spaces, for a combined total of
approximately
800
spaces.
FH
agrees that such additional parking
shall be constructed below grade
and within the existing property
line, with the surface lot to remain
at no more than 400 spaces. FH
shall place restrictions on the Parking Facility to prohibit the surface
of any parking deck from exceeding a height of five (5) feet above
the crown of Riveredge Road. FH
agrees that no ingress or egress to
the
parking
facility
shall
be
planned,
developed,
constructed,
maintained and/or permitted along
the southern, eastern, or western
boundaries of the parking facility.
Ingress and/or egress to the parking facility shall be planned, developed,
constructed,
maintained
and/or permitted solely from Old
Lorain Road, via a private access
road adjacent to the cul-de-sac to be
constructed at the westerly terminus of Fernshaw Avenue, as identified in Exhibit A.
FH shall comply with all of the
requirements imposed by any conditional
zoning
map
amendment
passed by Cleveland City Council to
allow FH to expand its existing
parking as stated above.
4.
Street
Vacation. The
City
Council will consider legislation to
vacate portions of Riveredge Road
and Fernshaw Avenue for the construction, maintenance and operation by FH of a private access
road to the Parking Facility and
to vacate Groveland Court as consideration for the covenants herein.

26
5. Old Lorain Road Improvements.
FH shall regrade and adjust Old
Lorain Road as agreed with the
Metroparks in October, 1998.
6. Landscape and Property Maintenance. FH
shall,
at
its
sole
expense, provide and maintain landscaping, as approved by the City
Planning Commission, within the
boundaries of the Campus Plan area
and the Neighborhood Park discussed in paragraph 7 herein.
7. Sale of Residential Properties
and
Neighborhood
Park.
FH
covenants never to purchase, rent,
lease or maintain a possessory interest in any residentially zoned real
property on Riveredge Road, south
of Fernshaw Avenue or on Fernshaw Avenue, unless specifically
authorized herein. Further, FH shall
sell residential lots owned by FH
along Riveredge Road, as identified
by the legal descriptions attached
hereto as Exhibit B, excluding two
(2) parcels currently maintained as
a Neighborhood Park, known as Permanent Parcel Nos. 026-02-024 and
026-02-026. FH shall retain ownership of the Neighborhood Park and
shall maintain the area in its natural, field-like condition.
For purposes of selling the other
residential
lots
owned
along
Riveredge Road by FH, FH shall
contract with a real estate agent
with an office location in the
Kamms Corner area. The purchase
price shall not be less than fair market value, as determined by an independent appraiser selected by FH.
FH shall use its continual best
efforts to secure a purchaser(s) for
the lots at an amount equal to or
greater than fair market value. In
the event, however, that the lots
have not been purchased within two
(2) years of the date they are first
placed on the market, FH may maintain ownership of the lots. Any lot
retained by FH after compliance
with the terms of this article, shall
be used solely for residential purposes by FH. FH shall ensure that
a copy of each purchase offer is provided to the City Planning Commission and the Council member of
Ward 21 within 5 business days of
receipt by FH. FH shall inform the
City Planning Commission and the
Council member of Ward 21, in writing, whether the purchase offer has
been accepted or rejected. In the
event of a rejection, FH shall document the reasons therefore.
8. Deed Restrictions. With respect
to the residential lots to be sold pursuant to paragraph 7 herein, FH
shall ensure that the deeds for the

restriction
prohibiting
FH
from
reacquiring title to the properties.
