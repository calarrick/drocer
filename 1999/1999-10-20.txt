Res. No. 1871-99.
By Councilmen Cimperman, Melena, Sweeney, Coats, White and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the State of Ohio Lottery Commission to reconsider its decision to
hold a second Pick 3 and Pick 4
drawing.
Whereas, the State of Ohio Lottery
Commission has recently decided to
expand its Pick 3 and Pick 4 number games in Ohio, and specifically
in Cleveland; and
Whereas, pursuant to an article
appearing in the Plain Dealer on
October 10, 1999, the lottery is generating an incredible amount of
money from the residents of the City
of Cleveland; and
Whereas, while this Council of the
City of Cleveland respects the rights
of citizens to freely choose the manner in which to spend their money
and to take part in these state sponsored games of chance, Council is
deeply concerned about the Ohio
Lottery Commission taking money
from working families who could
more wisely spend their money on
other expenditures such as food,
housing and clothing; and
Whereas, a second Pick 3 and
Pick 4 drawing of the lottery may
unfairly and unwisely target residents of neighborhoods in which
other
economic,
community
and
human
developments
should
be
funding
priorities,
rather
than
games of chance; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the State
Lottery Commission to reconsider its
decision to hold a second Pick 3 and
Pick 4 drawing, and to weigh the
potential for minimal winnings with
the tremendous negative side effects
in our neighborhoods.
Section 2. That the Council hereby requests that the Lottery Commission provide a full accounting of
its expenditures that benefit the
neighborhoods and residents of the
City of Cleveland and that the Director
of
the
Lottery
Commission
appear before the Council to present
that accounting.
Section
3.
That
the
Council
requests that the Lottery Commission identify the amount of money
generated by the Pick 3 and Pick 4

The City Record
in each neighborhood and expend a
proportionate amount for the betterment of that specific neighborhood.
Section 4. That, in the interest of
our residents, the Lottery Commission meet with local elected officials
to discuss the proposed expansion of
any lottery games prior to their
expansion.
Section 5. That this Council urges
the State legislature to review the
advantages and disadvantages of
holding a state sponsored lottery.
Section 6. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this Resolution to the following: Governor Robert Taft; all
Cleveland area State Representatives and State Senators; Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell; and Mitchell Brown, Director
of the Lottery Commission.
Section 7. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

(2) If there has been a transfer of
possession or ownership of a dangerous or vicious dog, within ten
(10) days after such transfer of
ownership or possession, the seller,
transferor, owner, keeper or harborer shall provide a completed copy of
