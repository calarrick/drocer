700 refugees.

cholera
and
other
disease;
the

33,000 people, with no reported
deaths from epidemics or starvation.
d. Clean water is available and
plentiful at Balkan refugee camps,
while refugees in Nairobi are given
3.5 gallons of water to last for 3
days for a family as large as 10; and

of Cleveland is concerned with the
humanitarian treatment and preservation of dignity for all refugees,
whether in the Balkans, Africa or

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

2. That in the event there is a
transfer of title to a non-affiliated
party of the non-hotel commercial
portion during the term of the TIF,
to a
party whose intended use is
other than non-hotel commercial,
redeveloper shall immediately retire
all outstanding obligations due the
City under the $1,000,000 Economic
Development Loan, and Redeveloper
shall pay to the City an amount
equal to all taxes the City would
have received from the time of execution of the TIF agreement to the
date of such transfer or sale of the
retail portions of the project, but for
the TIF.
3. Failure by Redeveloper or the
operator(s) of the project to substantially comply with the following
economic development objectives of
the Project shall be an event of

to the City an amount equal to the
taxes the City would have received

in the project within three (3) years
of passage of this ordinance;
b. The creation of 150 jobs at the

the passage of this ordinance and
the maintenance of these 150 jobs
throughout the duration of the TIF;
c. Compliance with Section 9 of
this ordinance; and
d. Renovation of the public open
space of the arcade and maintaining
same as open space for the public
use.
Section 9. 1. With respect to the
relationship with and activities of
any operator to the hotel located on
the Property, it is agreed that such
hotel operator shall recognize and
observe the right of its employees to
form or select any labor organization to act as the employees’ exclusive bargaining representative for
the purpose of collective bargaining
with the operator, or to refrain from
such activity, and the right of a
labor organization to organize the
employees.
2. With respect to the relationship
with and activities of the hotel operator, the Redeveloper agrees as a
condition of its financial assistance
from the City, in addition to the
foregoing, that the provisions set
forth in the section shall apply.
a. To accommodate a free and
informed decision of the employees
of the hotel respecting joining or
seeking representation by a labor
organization, the hotel operator will
provide access to certain non-work
areas within the hotel during certain non-work times, the exact locations and times to be mutually
agreed upon by both the union and
the hotel operator.
b. The hotel operator shall have
the right to communicate with its
employees during the organizing
process, shall insure that such communications are factual, and shall

May 26, 1999
neither show nor disseminate antiunion material in its communications with its employees.
c. Upon notice from the union that
at least 30% of employees in an
appropriate bargaining unit have
signed authorization cards, the hotel
operator and labor organization will
take all actions necessary to effect
validation of such cards within thirty (30) days by the National Labor
Relations Board (“NLRB”). If cards
signed by a majority of bargaining
unit employees are validated by the
NLRB, the employees will vote on
the question of representation by
the labor organization within sixty
(60) days from date of the NLRB
meeting to validate the cards. If a
majority of bargaining unit employees that vote, vote in favor of representation by a labor organization
the hotel operator will recognize
such labor organization as bargaining representative.
d. If one or more labor organizations notifies the hotel operator that
a majority of employees in a proposed bargaining unit or units have
signed authorization cards, the hotel
operator
will
make
good
faith
efforts to reach agreement and stipulate to the definition of a bargaining unit. The hotel operator will not
assert questions about the definition
of the bargaining unit as a means
of delaying or impeding the rights
of employees and labor organization(s) to proceed expeditiously to
an election under the NLRB supervision.
e. The hotel operator shall further
agree that interest demonstrated by

The City Record
employees of the hotel in joining or
not joining a labor organization or
membership with a labor organization shall not constitute grounds for
discriminatory or disparate treatment nor adversely impact a potential employee’s ability to be hired.
3. In the event the operator of the
hotel located on the Property is
found to have failed to perform or
observe the conditions set forth
above in Section 1. or 2. as evidenced by either: (i) a final judgment or order of the National Labor
Relations Board or court of competent jurisdiction, which final judgment or order is not subject to further appeal, or (ii) a finding by the
City of Cleveland as set forth in a
written notice of default sent by the
City’s Director of Economic Development, the Redeveloper shall, within thirty (30) days after such judgment or order becomes final (or
within such longer period as may be
reasonably required), or within thirty (30) days (or within such longer
period
as
may
be
reasonably
required) after City’s sending of the
notice of default:
a. Cause such hotel operator to
comply with such order or judgment
and any remedial action required
thereunder;
b. If the hotel operator does not
comply with Section 3.a. within the
time periods set forth therein, the
Redeveloper can terminate the contract of such hotel operator to operate such hotel and obtain a qualified replacement hotel operator who
will operate in conformity with the
above requirements.

31
In the event Redeveloper fails to
comply with its requirements set
forth in this Section 3. the loan
agreement shall be terminated as of
the date of such failure. Also as of

would have received but for the
TIF.”.

its committees that resulted in such
formal action were in meetings open

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 877-99.
By Councilman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting the passage of Ohio House Bill
53, providing equal insurance coverage for mental illnesses and substance abuse disorders.
Whereas, over 50 million Americans suffer from mental illness or
substance abuse disorders on an
annual basis; and
Whereas, over 170,000 residents in
Cuyahoga County, representing approximately 1 out of 10 people or 1
out of 4 families, are experiencing
some type of mental illness; and
Whereas, scientific research has
demonstrated that mental illnesses are
biological brain disorders and are
physically induced diseases, as are
cancer, heart disease and diabetes; and
Whereas, according to the Cuyahoga County Community Mental
Health Board, 96% of health insurance plans provide inferior coverage
for mental illnesses and addictions
compared to other illnesses; and
Whereas, actuarial studies have
shown that the cost of providing
equal or comparable insurance coverage for mental illnesses only
increases costs by 3.1%; and
Whereas, providing equal coverage for all illnesses makes good economic sense since untreated or
undertreated mental illnesses cause
health care costs to escalate; and
Whereas, providing equal coverage for mental illnesses is also
humanitarian in that those afflicted
are able to be treated and have an
opportunity to be well; and
Whereas, 19 states have passed
parity laws and 13 states have legislation pending; and

May 26, 1999
Whereas,
State
Representative
Lynn Olman has introduced legislation, House Bill 53, to bring equal
insurance
coverage
for
Mental
Health and Substance Abuse Disorders in Ohio; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland recognizes the
need for equal health insurance coverage for people who are inflicted
with mental illness or substance
abuse disorders and urges the Ohio
General Assembly to adopt House
Bill 53.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this resolution to the following: Secretary of Health and
Human
Services
Donna
Shalala;
Governor Robert Taft; Speaker of
the House JoAnn Davidson; and the
Cuyahoga County Commissioners.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted May 17, 1999.
Effective May 26, 1999.
Res. No. 878-99.
By Councilmen Jones and Johnson
(by departmental request).
An emergency resolution approving the report of the assessment
equalization board on objections concerning estimated assessments for

of way by removing, planting, trimming, watering and creating or excavating cut-outs for shade trees and
other related activities in and along

Whereas, the assessment equalization board appointed by Resolution
No. 533-99, adopted March 29, 1999, as

passed April 12, 1999, to hear and

Maintenance District in the City of
Cleveland by removing, planting,
trimming, watering and creating or
excavating cut-outs for shade trees,
