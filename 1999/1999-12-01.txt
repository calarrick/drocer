ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 2071-99.
By Councilman Cintron.
An emergency resolution supporting the rapid passage of H.R. 289/S.
1591 to restore control of Vieques to
the Government of Puerto Rico and
urging President Clinton to immediately cease using the island as a
bombing and firing range for military exercises.
Whereas,
Vieques
is
a
small
island on the eastern end of Puerto
Rico, with a land area of approximately 33,000 acres, and is home to
9,300 U.S. Citizens; and
Whereas, the United States Navy,
through eminent domain, assumed
control of more than three-quarters
of the Vieques in 1941 for naval
maneuvers. The Navy uses the eastern end of Vieques as a bombing
range, both from ships and the air,
and
as
an
amphibious
landing
maneuver; the western side is used
for the maintenance of an ammunition dump and radar equipment. The
Viequenses live in the middle of the
island, between the naval operations; and
Whereas, the people of Vieques
are forced to live in war-like conditions on a daily basis; and
Whereas, on April 19, 1999, during
a Navy air training mission, two 500
pound bombs were dropped on a
guard station, resulting in the death
of a civilian security guard and the
injury of four other persons; and
Whereas, the Vieques’ population
is plagued with other problems
believed to be the result of U.S.
naval presence and the use and testing of chemical weapons such as
napalm and depleted uranium; such
problems include: a cancer rate 27%
higher than that in Puerto Rico; an
excessively high poverty rate of
73%; and an infant mortality rate
among the highest of any municipality in Puerto Rico; and

2229

17
Whereas, there is bipartisan legislation pending before Congress,
H.R. 2890/S. 1591, that seeks to
restore control of Vieques to the
Government of Puerto Rico; and
Whereas, this resolution constititutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety in
that the people of Vieques are suffering daily from the presence of
the United States Navy, now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland supports the rapid
passage of H.R. 289/S. 1591 to
restore control of Vieques to the
Government of Puerto Rico and
urges President Clinton to immediately cease using the island as a
bombing and firing range for military exercises.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to the following:
President
Clinton;
all
Cleveland
area Representatives to the U.S.
House of Representatives; and Senators Voinovich and DeWine.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 22, 1999.
Effective November 29, 1999.

Res. No. 2072-99.
By Councilman Robinson.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the transfer of
ownership of a C1 Liquor Permit to
3350 E. 116th St. and repealing Res.
No. 1673-99, objecting to said transfer of ownership.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the transfer of ownership of a C1
Liquor Permit to 3350 E. 116th St.,
by Res. No. 1673-99, adopted on September 20, 1999
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
transfer of ownership and consents
to said transfer of ownership; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to the
transfer of ownership of a C1 Liquor
Permit to 3350 E. 116th St., be and
the same is hereby withdrawn and
Res. No. 1673-99, containing said
objection, be and the same is hereby repealed and that this Council
consents to the immediate transfer
of ownership thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 22, 1999.
Effective November 29, 1999.

Ord. No. 138-99.
By Councilmen Gordon, Jackson,
Robinson and Johnson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic
Development to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement with National Boiler Works, Inc. to provide for
a ten year abatement for certain
tangible personal property and real
estate taxes as an incentive to
expand its facility to acquire land,
construct an office and warehouse
facility, and to acquire machinery
and equipment at 4560 Industrial
Parkway located in the Cleveland
Area Enterprise Zone.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 948-95, passed June 19, 1995, this
Council designated an area which is
in
the
City
of
Cleveland
and
described in File No. 948-95-A, as the
Cleveland
Area
Enterprise
Zone
(the “Zone”) pursuant to Chapter
5709 of the Ohio Revised Code; and
Whereas, in August, 1995, the
Director of Development of the State
of Ohio determined that the Zone
contains the characteristics set forth
in Section 5709.61(A) of the Revised
Code and certified said area as an
“Urban Jobs and Enterprise Zone”
pursuant to Chapter 5709 of the
Revised Code; and
Whereas, National Boiler Works,
Inc. (the “Enterprise”) has proposed
to expand its facility to acquire
land, construct an office and warehouse
facility,
and
to
acquire
machinery and equipment at 4560
Industrial Parkway located in the
Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone;
and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that, but for abatement of personal property and real
estate taxes the Enterprise would be
at a competitive disadvantage by
operating at this location; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure in that
the same provides for the immediate
preservation of the public peace,
safety, property, and welfare and
for the further reason that its enactment is a necessary prerequisite to
providing immediate assistance to
create and preserve job opportunities and advance and promote commercial and economic development
in the City of Cleveland, such assistance being immediately necessary
or such jobs will be lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
approves
the
application
of
National Boiler Works, Inc. for
enterprise zone incentives on the
basis that National Boiler Works,
Inc. is qualified by financial responsibility and business experience to
create and preserve employment
opportunities in the Cleveland Area
Enterprise Zone and to improve the
economic climate of the City of
Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Director of
Economic Development is authorized to enter into an Enterprise
Zone
Agreement
with
National
Boiler Works, Inc. to provide for a
ten (10) year abatement for certain
tangible personal property and real
estate taxes as an incentive to
expand its facility to acquire land,
construct an office and warehouse
facility, and to acquire machinery
and equipment at 4560 Industrial
Parkway located in Cleveland, Ohio;
said abatement shall be subject to
annual review of the Tax Incentive
Review Council.

The City Record
Section 3. That the terms of said
tax abatement shall be in accordance with the terms as set forth in
the Executive Summary contained
in File No. 138-99-A. The terms of
said file notwithstanding, the terms
of the tax abatement shall not be
amended, nor shall the tax abatement
be assignable or transferrable to any
entity, without the prior legislative
authorization by Cleveland City Council, except that the existing text of
the Executive Summary, beginning
with the heading “Department Recommendation:” on page 3, and ending at the bottom of page 3, is
striken and in lieu thereof, the following text is substituted:
Department Recommendation:
The
Department
of
Economic
Development recommends approval
of the Enterprise Zone tax incentives subject to the company using
its best efforts to:
•employ minority persons for at
least 33 1/3% of new permanent

•employ City of Cleveland residents for at least 50% of new permanent jobs;

which are certified by the City of
Cleveland’s Office of Equal Opportunity;
•employ minority and female persons for at least 25% and 6.9 respectively, of all on-site coonstructionjobs.
Section 4. That the Director of

authorized to charge and accept fees
in an amount not to exceed the maximum allowable under Chapter 5709

are hereby appropriated for the purposes set forth in Chapter 5709 of
the Revised Code. Such fees shall be
deposited to and expended from

Section 5. That the Director of
Law shall prepare and approve said
agreement and that said agreement
shall contain such terms and provisions as he deems necessary to protect the City’s interest.
