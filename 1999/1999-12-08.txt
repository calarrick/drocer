It has been my privilege to serve
as Councilman for the residents of
Ward 19 of the City of Cleveland
since January, 1996. As you are

The City Record

4
aware, however, I was recently
elected to serve as judge for the
Cleveland Municipal Court.
It is with mixed emotions that I
must submit this letter of resignation from Cleveland City Council,
effective
December
2,
1999.
My
tenure in Council has been both
challenging and rewarding. Cleveland City Council is blessed with
hard-working, intelligent members
for whom I have the utmost respect.
It is an experience that I will
always treasure. Nevertheless, I am
looking forward to serving the citizens of Cleveland in my new role as
judge and hope that it will be as
equally challenging and rewarding.
Unfortunately, it is necessary for
me to resign from my seat in Council and nominate my successor earlier than I would have otherwise
liked since I must attend a mandatory judicial training session. The
residents of Ward 19 are in need of
and deserving of a representative
that can devote full attention to the
needs of the area. In addition, my
resignation at this time will result
in the election for a Ward 19 Council representative being held at the
same time of the regularly scheduled spring, 2000 election, thus saving
Cleveland
taxpayers
the
expense of holding a special election to fill the seat
I wish you and my colleagues on
Council all the best in meeting the
needs of the citizens of Cleveland. I
look forward to continued work
with Council to help meet those
needs.
Sincerely,
Joseph Zone
Received.
