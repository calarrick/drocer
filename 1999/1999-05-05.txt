(b) The Commission shall propose

provide a reasonable opportunity for
all interested parties to express

Deli, 14731 Miles Ave. & Patio,
Cleveland, Ohio 44128; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to

has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health

permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department

respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good

An emergency resolution urging
AMPCO and APCOA to permit a
union representation campaign by
Teamsters Local No. 507 to be conducted in an open, fair environment.
Whereas,
through
passage
of
numerous resolutions, this Council
of the City of Cleveland has recognized the right of employees to
seek
safe,
fair
and
productive
working conditions and to be remunerated equitably for their hard
work; and
Whereas, Teamsters Local Union
No. 507 currently represents approximately 3200 active and 900 retired
members in many industries, including more than 100 parking employees hired by APCOA and a small
group of parking employees hired
by AMPCO; and
Whereas, the parking industry is
extremely lucrative, with AMPCO
generating over $760 million in
annual sales in 1992, over $1 billion
in annual sales in 1996, and over
$1.25 billion in annual sales in 1998;
and
Whereas, these phenomenal annual profits fail to trickle down to the
parking attendants actually performing
the
work,
with
such
employees working in adverse conditions and in inclement weather
while receiving low wages and inadequate health insurance coverage;
and
Whereas, AMPCO employees are
working under union contracts in
other cities and this Council of the
City of Cleveland encourages such
open-mindedness
by
AMPCO
in
Cleveland, now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

City of Cleveland is supportive of
safe, productive working conditions
with equitable pay for all workers
