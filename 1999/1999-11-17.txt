Cleveland City Council
Room 216, City Hall
601 Lakeside Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Dear Council President Polensek:
I have given serious consideration
to our discussions about the future
of the Council under your leadership
and the manner in which, as Clerk,
I could assist you and the residents
of Cleveland. I have concluded, however, that it is in the best interests
of Council that you should have the
ability to propose your own candidate for Clerk. Although I appreciate your expressions of support, I
hereby tender my resignation from
the office of the Clerk of City Council, effective upon the appointment
of my successor by the members of
City Council.

As we also discussed, in order to
ensure a smooth transition in the
leadership of Council, I am willing
to continue as a member of Council’s staff for a period of time as
determined by you to be necessary
in order to assist the new Clerk in
the performance of his or her duties.
I am available to further discuss
the arrangements for the transition
at your convenience.
Sincerely,
Cecelia R. Huffman
Received.

Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Chapter 189 relating to payment of a Living Wage.
Whereas, it is beneficial to the
health and welfare of all citizens of
the City of Cleveland that all workers are paid an hourly wage which
enables them to live above the level
of poverty and reduces the amount
of taxpayer funded social service
programs in the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, this legislation provides
for a prevailing minimum hourly
wage for employees employed by
persons
or
entities,
which
are
awarded contracts by, for, or on
behalf of the City of Cleveland and
receive economic assistance in conjunction with such contracts; and
Whereas, many employers who
receive financial assistance from
the City do not provide comprehensive
health
insurance
to
their
employees, thereby negatively affecting work performance; and
Whereas, this legislation ensures
that contractors with the City provide health insurance benefits to all
their employees or, in the alternative, ensures that these contractors
provide an increased hourly wage to
employees not provided with such
insurance benefits so that employees may afford necessary health
care; and
Whereas, the purpose of this legislation is to provide for a livable
wage and health insurance benefits
for workers employed by employers
receiving assistance from the City
and, as a result, enhance the welfare of workers in the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

By Councilman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
Cleveland’s congressional delegation
to devote their attention, power and
compassion to assist the people of
El Salvador.
Whereas, El Salvador is a small
country located in Central America,
but has borne an inordinate amount
of strife for such a small nation; and
Whereas, during the last three
decades of this century, the people
of El Salvador have been subjected
to great turmoil and civil war, with
the slaying of nearly 75,000 people;
the unaccounted for disappearance
of untold numbers of people, and the
displacement of almost one-third of
the population; and

The City Record
Whereas, three especially heinous
events have received world-wide
media attention: the assassination of
Archbishop Romero in March, 1980;
the killing of four North American
missionary women, two of whom
were
natives
of
Cleveland,
in
December, 1980; and the massacre of
six Jesuit priests and two women coworkers in November, 1989; and
Whereas, the Jesuit Order has
been in El Salvador providing education and faith service to thousands of people through the University of Central America, with their
presence well known to the government, military, and most notably to
the poor for whom they have provided preferential concern; and in
return for their kind and humanitarian efforts, members of the Order
are subject to great physical risk;
and
Whereas, the United States government, as a powerful, wealthy and
just country, should support grass
roots economic development in El
Salvador
and
should
urge
the
IMF/World Bank to forgive El Salvador’s debt; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
