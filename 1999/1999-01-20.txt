Whereas, this Council has determined that, in order to timely
respond to the increasing demand
for air service at Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport, and to plan
for future demands for air service,
it is necessary to acquire neighboring property to increase the Airport
site, with the desired consequence of
increasing the capacity of Airport
operations; and
Whereas, that acquisition will provide needed property for the provi-

sion of air services to the public,
and the prompt commencement of
the acquisition requires the issuance
of the subordinated revenue notes
authorized hereunder and the undertaking of the transactions contemplated herein, and it is necessary to
issue such notes as soon as possible
to take advantage of favorable conditions in the financial markets,

Section, taking into account other

provided
in

Award, provided that a separate Certificate of Award shall be executed

of Notes shall be awarded and sold

Notes of each series shall be dated

Section 4. Interest. The Notes of

the date of the respective series at
the rate per annum set forth in the
Certificate of Award, or if any Notes
bear interest at a variable rate, at
the rate determined pursuant to the
method set forth in the Certificate
of Award. Interest on the Notes
shall be payable on the dates determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award and until
the principal amount is paid or payment is provided for. If any Notes
bear interest at a fixed rate, that
rate shall not exceed six and onehalf percent (6-1/2%) per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months)
and interest shall be payable not
more often than every six months
and at maturity or at any earlier
redemption date. If any Notes bear
interest at a variable rate or rates,
those rates shall not exceed that set
forth in Section 5, and interest shall

be payable not more often than once
a month and following purchase and
at
maturity
or
at
any
earlier
redemption date.
Section 5. Variable Rate Notes. In
the event
that
the Director of
Finance determines that the City’s
best interests will be served by causing all or a portion of the Notes to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
so specify in the Certificate of
Award. If the Director of Finance so
determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Notes shall be determined,
whether by reference to a market
index, by a remarketing agent or
otherwise; provided that the variable
rate Notes shall not bear interest at
a rate in excess of twelve percent
(12%) per annum. That maximum
interest rate shall not apply to variable rate Notes during any period
those Notes are held by a provider
of
a
Credit Support
Instrument
because they could not be remarketed and the terms of the Credit Support Instrument do not permit such
a maximum rate of interest. Holders
of variable rate Notes may be given
the right to tender their variable
rate Notes for purchase by the City
at the times, on the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Certificate of Award and any tender
agreement;
provided
that
tender
rights shall be exercisable only at
such times as a Credit Support
Instrument is in place that provides
for the payment of the purchase
price payable to the tendering holder of a variable rate Note. If the
Director of Finance designates any
Notes as variable rate Notes, and if
the holders of the variable rate
Notes are to be entitled to tender the
variable rate Notes for purchase,
then the Director of Finance shall
also designate in the Certificate of
Award for those variable rate Notes
the provider or providers for any
Credit Support Instrument, the tender agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance that the parties so designated possess the requisite resources
and experience to provide the services required of them and that the
terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of
the variable rate Notes, and from
time to time thereafter so long as
the variable rate Notes are outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments, tender agents
(which may
be
the
Registrar),
remarketing agents, and others as
may be determined by the Director
of Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right of
tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of the
variable rate Notes upon tender for
purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the City of
any amounts drawn under the Credit Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of

the Notes, and regardless of the
Notes bearing interest at variable or
fixed rates, is authorized to contract
for a Credit Support Instrument, and
to pay the costs of it from proceeds
of the Notes, if he determines that
the Credit Support Instrument will
result in a savings in the cost of
this financing to the City.
Section
6.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges on the Notes; Redemption.
The debt charges on the Notes shall
be payable in lawful money of the
United States of America, or in Federal Reserve funds of the United
States of America as determined by
the Director of Finance in the Certificate of Award, and shall be
payable, without deduction for services of the Registrar (as defined in
Section 7) as the City’s paying
agent. If agreed to by the Original
Purchaser, the Notes shall be subject to redemption without penalty
or premium at the option of the City
in whole or in part at any time prior
to maturity as provided in this Ordinance.
If fewer than all of the outstanding Notes are called for optional
redemption at one time and Notes of
more than one maturity are then
outstanding, the Notes that are
called shall be called as selected by,
and selected in a manner determined by, the City. If fewer than all
of the Notes of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Notes
of
that
maturity
to
be
redeemed, or portions thereof in
amounts of the minimum authorized
denomination or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by lot in
a manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Notes by lot when Notes of
denominations greater than the minimum authorized denomination are
then outstanding, each unit of principal thereof in the amount of the
minimum authorized denomination
shall be treated as if it were a separate Note of the denomination of
the minimum authorized denomination. If it is determined that one or
more, but not all, of the units of
principal amount in the amount of
the minimum authorized denomination represented by a Note are to be
called for redemption, then, upon
notice of redemption of such unit or
units, the registered owner of that
Note shall surrender the Note to the
Registrar (i) for payment of the
redemption price of such unit or
units of principal amount called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption), and (ii)
for issuance, without charge to the
registered owner, of a new Note or
Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Note surrendered.
The notice of the call for redemption of Notes shall identify (i) by
designation, letters, numbers, or
other
distinguishing
marks,
the
Notes or portions thereof to be
redeemed, (ii) the redemption price
to be paid, (iii) the date fixed for
redemption, and (iv) the place or
places where the amounts due upon
redemption are payable. The notice
shall be given by the Registrar on
behalf of the City by mailing a copy
of the redemption notice by first
class mail, postage prepaid, at least
30 days prior to the date fixed for
redemption, to the registered owner

of each Note subject to redemption
in whole or in part at the registered
owner’s address shown on the Note
Register (as defined in Section 7)
maintained by the Registrar at the
close of business on the 15th day
preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Note,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Note.
In
the
event
that
notice
of
redemption shall have been given
by the Registrar to the registered
owners as provided above, there
shall be deposited with the Registrar on or prior to the redemption
date, moneys that, in addition to
any other moneys available therefor
and held by the Registrar, will be
sufficient to redeem at the redemption price thereof, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date, all
of the redeemable Notes for which
notice
of
redemption
has
been
given. Notice having been mailed in
the manner provided in the preceding paragraph hereof, the Notes and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
accrued
interest to the redemption date. If
moneys for the redemption of all of
the Notes and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with accrued
interest thereon to the redemption
date, are held by the Registrar on
the redemption date, so as to be
available therefor on that date and,
if notice of redemption has been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
those moneys shall not be so available on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Notes and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All moneys
held by
the Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Notes shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Notes.
Section 7. Registrar. The Director
of Finance shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent, and paying agent for
the Notes after determining that the
payment at that bank or trust company will not endanger the funds or
securities of the City and that proper procedures and safeguards are
available for that purpose (the
“Registrar”).
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a registrar agreement or agreements between the City and the
Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”) in a form consistent with
this Ordinance and as approved by
the Director of Law. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Notes to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully

available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose.
The Notes shall be issued only as
fully registered Notes. Principal on
the Notes shall be payable when due
upon presentation and surrender of
the Notes at the designated office of
the Registrar designated in the Registrar Agreement. Interest on each
Note shall be paid on each interest
payment date by check or draft
mailed to the person in whose name
the Note was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing on the
Note Register (defined below in this
Section) at the close of business on
the 15th day of the calendar month
next preceding that interest payment date. The City will cause the
Registrar to maintain and keep all
books and records necessary for the
registration, exchange, and transfer
of Notes as provided in this Section
(the “Note Register”) so long as any
of the Notes remain outstanding.
Subject to the provisions of this Section, the person in whose name a
Note is registered on the Note Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Note for all
purposes of the Note Proceedings.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Registrar shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary, but the registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
and so long as the Notes are issued
in a book entry system, principal of
and interest on the Notes shall be
payable in the manner provided in
any agreement entered into by the
Director of Finance, in the name
and on behalf of the City, in connection with the book entry system.
Section 8. Transfer and Exchange
of Certain Notes. Notes may be
exchanged for Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the office designated by the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
office designated by the Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
Upon exchange or transfer, the Registrar shall complete, authenticate,
and deliver a new Note or Notes of
the same series, of any authorized
denomination or authorized denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
the Note Proceedings. The exchange
or transfer shall be without charge

to the owner, except that the City
and Registrar may make a charge
sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
special obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under the Note Proceedings, as the
Notes
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer. Neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
required to make any exchange or
transfer of a Note during the period
beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the
mailing of a notice of redemption of
Notes and ending at the close of
business on the day of such mailing
or to transfer or exchange any Note
selected for redemption in whole or
in part.
Section 9. Book Entry. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Ordinance, if it is determined
by the Director of Finance to be in
the best interests of and financially
advantageous to the City, the Notes
may be issued in book entry form
in accordance with the provisions of
this Section. As used in this Section
and this Ordinance:
The Notes may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized, (i) the
Notes may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Note representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the book entry
interest owners of Notes in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Notes in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii)
ownership of book entry interests in
book entry form shall be shown by
book entry on the system maintained and operated by the Depository and its Participants, and transfers of the ownership of book entry
interests shall be made only by book
entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv) the Notes as such
shall
not
be
transferable
or
exchangeable, except for transfer to
another Depository or to another
nominee of a Depository, without
further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Notes for use in a book entry
system, the Director of Finance may
attempt to establish a securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance does not or
is unable to do so, the Director of
Finance, after making provision for
notification of the book entry interest owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Notes from the Depository,
and authenticate and deliver note
certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance also is
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to

enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the Notes,
after determining that the signing
thereof will not endanger the funds
or securities of the City and after
the approval of the form of any such
agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 10. Execution of Notes.
Notes shall be signed by the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, in the
name of the City and in their official capacities, provided that either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile, and shall bear the seal
of the City or a facsimile thereof;
provided that no Note shall be valid
or obligatory for any purpose or
shall be entitled to any security or
benefit under the Note Proceedings
unless and until the certificate of
authentication printed on the Note is
signed by the Registrar as authenticating agent, and authentication
by the Registrar shall be conclusive
evidence that the Note so authenticated has been duly issued, signed
and delivered under, and is entitled
to the security and benefit of, the
Note Proceedings. The certificate of
authentication may be signed by
any authorized officer or employee
of the Registrar or by any other person acting as an agent of the Registrar and approved by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the City.
The same person need not sign the
certificate of authentication on all
of the Notes.
Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Notes and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature. The
Notes shall be issued in the denominations as requested by the Original Purchaser and approved by the
Director of Finance, in conformity
with this Ordinance. The entire principal amount may be represented by
a single note and may be issued as
fully registered securities and in
book entry or other uncertificated
form if it is determined by the
Director of Finance that issuance of
fully registered securities in that
form will facilitate the sale and
delivery of the Notes. The Notes
may be issued in the authorized
denominations of either (a) $100,000
each or in any denomination that is
the sum of (i) $100,000 and (ii)
$5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and not exchangeable for other
Notes in denominations less than
$100,000, or (b) $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, as determined
by the Director of Finance in the
Certificate of Award to be in the
best interests of the City. The Notes
shall not have coupons attached,
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance and shall
express upon their faces the purpose, in summary terms, for which
they are issued and that they are
issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Sale of Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at not less than
97% of par plus accrued interest at
private sale by the Director of
Finance to the Original Purchaser
in accordance with law and the provisions of this Ordinance. If, in the
reasonable opinion of the Director of
Finance, an underwriter is incapable of fully performing its duties
or meeting its obligations in its
capacity as Original Purchaser with
respect to the Notes, the Director of
Finance is hereby authorized and
directed, in the name of and on

behalf of the City, to take whatever action may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser. The Director
of Finance shall sign the Certificate
of Award referred to in this Ordinance, evidencing that sale to the
Original Purchaser, cause the Notes
to be prepared, and have the Notes
signed and delivered, together with
a true transcript of proceedings
with reference to the issuance of the
Notes if requested by the Original
Purchaser, to the Original Purchaser upon payment of the purchase
price. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a note purchase agreement or agreements between the City and the
Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the “Purchase Agreement”), in a form consistent with
this Ordinance and as approved by
the Director of Law. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Notes to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose. The
Mayor, the Director of Finance, the
Clerk, the Director of Law, and
other City officials, as appropriate,
are each authorized and directed to
sign
any
transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 12. Security for the Notes.
The Notes are special obligations of
the City. The interest on the Notes,
unless paid from other sources available to the City, is secured solely
by, and is payable solely from Subordinated Airport Revenue.
The principal of the Notes, unless
paid from other sources available to
the City, is payable solely from the
proceeds of the Bonds. The City
covenants and agrees to do all
things
necessary
to
effect
the
issuance and delivery, prior to the
maturity of the Notes, of the Bonds
or any renewal notes, in that principal amount as may be necessary,
together with any other moneys
available to the City for the purpose, to pay the principal of the
Notes when due at maturity and to
do all things necessary to sell the
Bonds in sufficient time to permit
their delivery prior to the maturity
of the Notes. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Bonds
or of any renewal notes and any
excess funds resulting from the
issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used to pay the
debt charges on the Notes at maturity and are pledged for that purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the City covenants and agrees to
issue Additional Revenue Bonds as
defined in the Indenture to retire
the Notes which would be issued on
a
parity
with
Airport
Revenue
Bonds (as defined in the Indenture),
if and to the extent the City can satisfy the conditions precedent under
the Indenture for the issuance of
Additional Airport Revenue Bonds.
Further, if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of the Financial Advisor, that
under conditions of the market at
that time, the Bonds cannot be
issued with reasonable terms, the

City covenants and agrees that it
will issue obligations payable from
other City sources to retire the
Notes at maturity.
The City shall not be obligated to
pay principal of and interest on the
Notes from any funds or sources
other than those described in this
Section, and the Notes shall not be
a claim upon or lien against any
other property of the City. The
Notes, as to both principal and interest, are not general obligations of
the City, and the full faith and credit of the City is not pledged to their
payment. The holders of the Notes
shall have no right to have taxes
levied by the City for the payment
of principal of and interest on the
Notes.
Nothing
herein,
however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the City,
of its own volition, from using, to
the extent that it is authorized by
law to do so, any other resources for
the fulfillment of any of the terms,
conditions, or obligations of this
Ordinance or of the Notes.
The City will observe and perform
all its agreements and obligations
provided for by the Notes or this
Ordinance. All of the obligations
under this Ordinance are hereby
established as duties specifically
enjoined by law and resulting from
an office, trust, or station upon the
City within the meaning of Section
2731.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, after consultation
with the Financial Advisor, a trust
agreement providing, among other
things, for the holding in trust by a
bank of a debt service fund, debt
service reserve fund or similar fund
to secure the Notes is in the best
interest of and financially advantageous to the City, such trust agreement and fund or funds are hereby
authorized and the Mayor, Director
of Finance, Director of Port Control
and other City officials, as appropriate, are authorized to take such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate such additional security for the Notes. Such trust
agreement may be supplemental to
the Indenture. The City hereby
covenants and agrees to appropriate
annually from the Subordinated Airport Revenue into any such funds
amounts sufficient to maintain the
balances
required
by
the
trust
agreement and to restore any deficiency therein.
Section 13. Note Proceeds. The pro ceeds from the sale of the Notes,
except any premium and accrued
interest and except any portion of
the proceeds representing a required
deposit to a debt service reserve
fund created pursuant to Section 12,
shall be paid into the proper fund
or funds and those proceeds are
appropriated and shall be used for
the purpose for which the Notes are
being issued. Any portion of the proceeds
representing
a
required
deposit to a debt service reserve
fund created pursuant to Section 12
shall be paid into that debt service
reserve fund.
Section 14. Disclosure. If, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
after consultation with the Financial Advisor and the Original Purchaser, an official statement or
other disclosure document is appropriate relating to the initial offering
of
the
Notes,
the
Director
of
Finance, on behalf of the City and
in that officer’s official capacity, is
authorized to (i) cooperate with the
Original Purchaser in the prepara-

tion of, and the making of modifications, completions or changes of
or supplements to, such a disclosure
document, (ii) determine, and to certify or otherwise represent, when
the disclosure document is to be
deemed final or is final, (iii) authorize the use and distribution of that
disclosure document and any supplements thereto in connection with
the initial offering of the Notes, and
(iv) sign certificates, statements or
other documents in connection with
the finality, accuracy, and completeness of that disclosure document.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes, the City agrees, as the
only obligated person with respect
to the Notes under the Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data, audited financial statements
and notices, in such manner, as may
be required for purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of the Rule. In
order to describe and specify certain
terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose,
and
thereby
to
implement
that
agreement, including provisions for
enforcement, amendment, and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, and if required under
the Rule, a Continuing Disclosure
Certificate or Certificates in conformance with the reporting requirements of the Rule. The agreement
formed, collectively, by this paragraph and that Certificate, shall be
the
City’s
continuing
disclosure
agreement for purposes of the Rule,
and its performance shall be subject
to the annual appropriation of any
funds that may be necessary to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Section 15. Ratings, Insurance,
and Other Credit Enhancement. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance after consultation with the
Original Purchaser, the filing of an
application for (i) a rating on the
Notes by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies, (ii) a policy of insurance or other credit
enhancement facility from a company or companies to better assure the
payment of principal of and interest
on the Notes, or (iii) a surety bond
or other credit enhancement facility
from a company or other companies
to satisfy any reserve requirement
for the Notes is in the best interest
of and financially advantageous to
this City, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare and submit
those applications, to provide to
each such agency, company or other
credit enhancement facility provider
such information as may be required
for the purpose. The cost of obtain-

ing each such rating, policy, bond or
credit enhancement facility, except
to the extent paid by the Original
Purchaser in accordance with the
Purchase Agreement, shall be paid
from the proceeds of the Notes.
Section 16. Interest Rate Swaps,
Hedges and Caps. For the purpose
of achieving the optimal available
debt structure for the Notes, the
Director of Finance may, based on
the written advice of the Financial
Advisor, enter into one or more
agreements in connection with or
subsequent to the issuance of the
Notes for an interest rate swap, an
interest rate cap or other such
arrangement to lower the effective
interest rate on the obligations to
the City or to hedge the exposure of
the City against fluctuations in prevailing interest rates, provided, however, that: (i) the debt structure that
is simulated through the combination of the Notes with any such
agreements shall comply with the
restrictions of this Ordinance on the
terms of and security for the Notes
applied to that structure as though
it consisted solely of Notes; (ii) the
counterparty to any swap agreement
and the provider of any interest rate
cap shall have a rating of at least
“A” by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or Standard & Poor’s Corporation; (iii) no such agreement
shall purport to entitle the counterparty to the agreement to payment
by the City from any source other
than the sources which secure the
Notes as described in this Ordinance;
(iv) the cost of obtaining any such
interest rate cap or other such
arrangement shall have been determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of the
Financial Advisor, to be justified by
the corresponding benefit to the
City and to be commercially reasonable based on then current market conditions. The notional amount
on which any such agreement is
based shall not be subject to the
limitations set forth herein on the
maximum principal amount of the
Notes.
Section 17. Tax Covenants. The
City covenants that it will use, and
will restrict the use and investment
of, the proceeds of the Notes in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the Notes
will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii)
be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest on the
Notes will not be treated as an item
of tax preference under Section 57
of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes to
be and remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting
for it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Notes to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports and
(v) refrain from certain uses of

those proceeds, and, as applicable,
of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes is hereby
authorized (a) to make or effect any
election,
selection,
designation,
choice, consent, approval, or waiver
on behalf of the City with respect
to the Notes as the City is permitted to or required to make or give
under the federal income tax laws,
including, without limitation thereto, any of the elections provided for
in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the Code
or available under Section 148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the Notes
or interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that
purpose, reducing the burden or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
or penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Notes, and (c) to
give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for inclusion in
the transcript of proceedings for the
Notes, setting forth the reasonable
expectations of the City regarding
the amount and use of all the proceeds of the Notes, the facts, circumstances and estimates on which
they are based, and other facts and
circumstances relevant to the tax
treatment of the interest on and the
tax status of the Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provisions of this Ordinance to the contrary, if the Director of Finance determines prior to
the execution and delivery of any
Purchase Agreement that it is necessary and appropriate and in the
best interests of the City for the
interest on the Notes to be included
in gross income for federal income
tax purposes, the City shall not be
bound by the covenants of this Section with respect to the Notes.
Section 18. Captions, Headings,

describe the scope or intent of any
Sections, subsections, paragraphs,
subparagraphs, or clauses hereof.

Section 19. Interpretation. Any pro visions of the Codified Ordinances
of the City which are inconsistent
with the provisions of this Ordinance shall not apply to the Notes
authorized herein. Nothing in this
Ordinance is intended to, and no provision hereof shall be applied in any
manner as would, impair the obligation of contract of the City with
respect to any outstanding bonds,
notes, certificates of indebtedness,

other obligations, trust indentures,
trust agreements, or other agreements or contracts made or entered
into by the City.
Section 20. Satisfaction of Conditions. This Council determines that
all acts and conditions necessary to
be done or performed by the City or

to make them legal, valid, and binding special obligations of the City
have been performed and have been
met, or will at the time of delivery
of the Notes have been performed

due form as required by law, and
that no limitation of indebtedness or
taxation, either statutory or constitutional,
is
applicable
to
the
issuance of the Notes.

Whereas, this Council has determined that, in order to timely
respond to the increasing demand
for air service at Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport, and to plan
for future demands for air service,
it is necessary to acquire neighboring property to increase the Airport
site, with the desired consequence of
increasing the capacity of Airport
operations; and
Whereas, that acquisition will provide needed property for the provision of air services to the public,
and the prompt commencement of
the acquisition requires the issuance
of the subordinated revenue notes
authorized hereunder and the undertaking of the transactions contemplated herein, and it is necessary to
issue such notes as soon as possible
to take advantage of favorable conditions in the financial markets,
and, as a result, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public property, health,
and safety and for the usual and
daily

Section 3. Issuance of Notes. It is

in the preambles to this Ordinance,
and this Council determines, that
notes in the aggregate principal
amount not to exceed $40,000,000
(the “Notes”) shall be issued in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds, the proceeds of which will be
used to pay costs of the Project, to
pay costs of any Credit Support
Instrument with respect to the
Notes, to fund any debt service
reserve fund established under Section 12, and to pay costs of issuance
of the Notes. The Notes shall be
issued in the aggregate principal
amount not to exceed $40,000,000
that is determined by the Director
of Finance in the Certificate of
Award to be required to be issued
for the purposes stated above in this
Section, taking into account other
moneys available for such purposes.
The Notes may be issued from time
to time in one or more series if so
provided
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, provided that a separate Certificate of Award shall be executed
for each series and the last series
of Notes shall be awarded and sold
no later than December 31, 2000. The
Notes of each series shall be dated
the date of issuance of the respective series or such other date as is
designated in the Certificate of
Award, provided that such date
shall be no later than December 31,
2000. The Notes of each series shall
mature on a date to be determined
by the Director of Finance in the
Certificate of Award in accordance
with his determination of the best
interest of and financial advantages
to the City, provided that such date

shall not be later than two years
from the date of issuance of the
respective series of Notes.
Section 4. Interest. The Notes of
each series shall bear interest from
the date of the respective series at
the rate per annum set forth in the
Certificate of Award, or if any Notes
bear interest at a variable rate, at
the rate determined pursuant to the
method set forth in the Certificate
of Award. Interest on the Notes
shall be payable on the dates determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award and until
the principal amount is paid or payment is provided for. If any Notes
bear interest at a fixed rate, that
rate shall not exceed six and onehalf percent (6-1/2%) per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months)
and interest shall be payable not
more often than every six months
and at maturity or at any earlier
redemption date. If any Notes bear
interest at a variable rate or rates,
those rates shall not exceed that set
forth in Section 5, and interest shall
be payable not more often than once
a month and following purchase and
at
maturity
or
at
any
earlier
redemption date.
Section 5. Variable Rate Notes. In
the event that the Director of
Finance determines that the City’s
best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Notes
to be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
so specify in the Certificate of
Award. If the Director of Finance so
determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Notes shall be determined,
whether by reference to a market
index, by a remarketing agent or
otherwise; provided that the variable rate Notes shall not bear interest at a rate in excess of twelve percent (12%) per annum. That maximum interest rate shall not apply to
variable rate Notes during any period those Notes are held by a
provider of a Credit Support Instrument because they could not be
remarketed and the terms of the
Credit Support Instrument do not
permit such a maximum rate of
interest. Holders of variable rate
Notes may be given the right to tender their variable rate Notes for purchase by the City at the times, on
the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and any tender agreement;
provided that tender rights shall be
exercisable only at such times as a
Credit Support Instrument is in
place that provides for the payment
of the purchase price payable to the
tendering holder of a variable rate
Note. If the Director of Finance designates any Notes as variable rate
Notes, and if the holders of the variable rate Notes are to be entitled to
tender the variable rate Notes for
purchase,
then
the
Director
of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate Notes the provider or
providers for any Credit Support
Instrument, the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance that the parties

so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Notes,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the variable rate Notes are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support
Instruments,
tender
agents (which may be the Registrar), remarketing agents, and others as may be determined by the
Director of Finance to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders
the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of the variable rate Notes upon
tender for purchase or redemption,
and providing for the repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn
under the Credit Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
the Notes, and regardless of the
Notes bearing interest at variable or
fixed rates, is authorized to contract
for a Credit Support Instrument, and
to pay the costs of it from proceeds
of the Notes, if he determines that
the Credit Support Instrument will
result in a savings in the cost of
this financing to the City.
Section
6.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges on the Notes; Redemption.
The debt charges on the Notes shall
be payable in lawful money of the
United States of America, or in Federal Reserve funds of the United
States of America as determined by
the Director of Finance in the Certificate of Award, and shall be
payable, without deduction for services of the Registrar (as defined in
Section 7) as the City’s paying
agent. If agreed to by the Original
Purchaser, the Notes shall be subject to redemption without penalty
or premium at the option of the City
in whole or in part at any time prior
to maturity as provided in this
Ordinance.
If fewer than all of the outstanding Notes are called for optional
redemption at one time and Notes of
more than one maturity are then
outstanding, the Notes that are
called shall be called as selected by,
and selected in a manner determined by, the City. If fewer than all
of the Notes of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Notes
of
that
maturity
to
be
redeemed, or portions thereof in
amounts of the minimum authorized
denomination or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by lot in
a manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Notes by lot when Notes of
denominations greater than the minimum authorized denomination are
then outstanding, each unit of principal thereof in the amount of the
minimum authorized denomination
shall be treated as if it were a separate Note of the denomination of
the minimum authorized denomination. If it is determined that one or
more, but not all, of the units of
principal amount in the amount of
the minimum authorized denomination represented by a Note are to be
called for redemption, then, upon
notice of redemption of such unit or
units, the registered owner of that
Note shall surrender the Note to the

Registrar (i) for payment of the
redemption price of such unit or
units of principal amount called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption), and (ii)
for issuance, without charge to the
registered owner, of a new Note or
Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Note surrendered.
The notice of the call for redemption of Notes shall identify (i) by
designation, letters, numbers, or
other
distinguishing
marks,
the
Notes or portions thereof to be
redeemed, (ii) the redemption price
to be paid, (iii) the date fixed for
redemption, and (iv) the place or
places where the amounts due upon
redemption are payable. The notice
shall be given by the Registrar on
behalf of the City by mailing a copy
of the redemption notice by first
class mail, postage prepaid, at least
30 days prior to the date fixed for
redemption, to the registered owner
of each Note subject to redemption
in whole or in part at the registered
owner’s address shown on the Note
Register (as defined in Section 7)
maintained by the Registrar at the
close of business on the 15th day
preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Note,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Note.
In
the
event
that
notice
of
redemption shall have been given
by the Registrar to the registered
owners as provided above, there
shall be deposited with the Registrar on or prior to the redemption
date, moneys that, in addition to
any other moneys available therefor
and held by the Registrar, will be
sufficient to redeem at the redemption price thereof, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date, all
of the redeemable Notes for which
notice
of
redemption
has
been
given. Notice having been mailed in
the manner provided in the preceding paragraph hereof, the Notes and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
accrued
interest to the redemption date. If
moneys for the redemption of all of
the Notes and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with accrued
interest thereon to the redemption
date, are held by the Registrar on
the redemption date, so as to be
available therefor on that date and,
if notice of redemption has been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
those moneys shall not be so available on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Notes and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All moneys
held by
the Registrar for
the
redemption of particular Notes shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and

shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Notes.
Section 7. Registrar. The Director
of Finance shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent, and paying agent for
the Notes after determining that the
payment at that bank or trust company will not endanger the funds or
securities of the City and that proper procedures and safeguards are
available for that purpose (the
“Registrar”).
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a registrar agreement or agreements between the City and the
Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”) in a form consistent with
this Ordinance and as approved by
the Director of Law. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Notes to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose.
The Notes shall be issued only as
fully registered Notes. Principal on
the Notes shall be payable when due
upon presentation and surrender of
the Notes at the designated office of
the Registrar designated in the Registrar Agreement. Interest on each
Note shall be paid on each interest
payment date by check or draft
mailed to the person in whose name
the Note was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing on the
Note Register (defined below in this
Section) at the close of business on
the 15th day of the calendar month
next preceding that interest payment date. The City will cause the
Registrar to maintain and keep all
books and records necessary for the
registration, exchange, and transfer
of Notes as provided in this Section
(the “Note Register”) so long as any
of the Notes remain outstanding.
Subject to the provisions of this Section, the person in whose name a
Note is registered on the Note Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Note for all
purposes of the Note Proceedings.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Registrar shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary, but the registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
and so long as the Notes are issued
in a book entry system, principal of
and interest on the Notes shall be
payable in the manner provided in
any agreement entered into by the
Director of Finance, in the name
and on behalf of the City, in connection with the book entry system.
Section 8. Transfer and Exchange
of Certain Notes. Notes may be
exchanged for Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the office designated by the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.

A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
office designated by the Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
Upon exchange or transfer, the Registrar shall complete, authenticate,
and deliver a new Note or Notes of
the same series, of any authorized
denomination or authorized denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
the Note Proceedings. The exchange
or transfer shall be without charge
to the owner, except that the City
and Registrar may make a charge
sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
special obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under the Note Proceedings, as the
Notes
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer. Neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
required to make any exchange or
transfer of a Note during the period
beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the
mailing of a notice of redemption of
Notes and ending at the close of
business on the day of such mailing
or to transfer or exchange any Note
selected for redemption in whole or
in part.
Section 9. Book Entry. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Ordinance, if it is determined
by the Director of Finance to be in
the best interests of and financially
advantageous to the City, the Notes
may be issued in book entry form
in accordance with the provisions of
this Section. As used in this Section
and this Ordinance:
The Notes may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized, (i) the
Notes may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Note representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the book entry
interest owners of Notes in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Notes in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii)
ownership of book entry interests in
book entry form shall be shown by
book entry on the system maintained and operated by the Depository and its Participants, and transfers of the ownership of book entry
interests shall be made only by book
entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv) the Notes as such

shall
not
be
transferable
or
exchangeable, except for transfer to
another Depository or to another
nominee of a Depository, without
further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Notes for use in a book entry
system, the Director of Finance may
attempt to establish a securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance does not or
is unable to do so, the Director of
Finance, after making provision for
notification of the book entry interest owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Notes from the Depository,
and authenticate and deliver note
certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance also is
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the Notes,
after determining that the signing
thereof will not endanger the funds
or securities of the City and after
the approval of the form of any such
agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 10. Execution of Notes.
Notes shall be signed by the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, in the
name of the City and in their official capacities, provided that either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile, and shall bear the seal
of the City or a facsimile thereof;
provided that no Note shall be valid
or obligatory for any purpose or
shall be entitled to any security or
benefit under the Note Proceedings
unless and until the certificate of
authentication printed on the Note is
signed by the Registrar as authenticating agent, and authentication
by the Registrar shall be conclusive
evidence that the Note so authenticated has been duly issued, signed
and delivered under, and is entitled
to the security and benefit of, the
Note Proceedings. The certificate of
authentication may be signed by
any authorized officer or employee
of the Registrar or by any other person acting as an agent of the Registrar and approved by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the City.
The same person need not sign the
certificate of authentication on all
of the Notes.
Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Notes and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature. The
Notes shall be issued in the denominations as requested by the Original Purchaser and approved by the
Director of Finance, in conformity
with this Ordinance. The entire principal amount may be represented by
a single note and may be issued as
fully registered securities and in
book entry or other uncertificated
form if it is determined by the
Director of Finance that issuance of
fully registered securities in that
form will facilitate the sale and
delivery of the Notes. The Notes
may be issued in the authorized
denominations of either (a) $100,000
each or in any denomination that is
the sum of (i) $100,000 and (ii)

$5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and not exchangeable for other
Notes in denominations less than
$100,000, or (b) $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, as determined
by the Director of Finance in the
Certificate of Award to be in the
best interests of the City. The Notes
shall not have coupons attached,
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance and shall
express upon their faces the purpose, in summary terms, for which
they are issued and that they are
issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Sale of Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at not less than
97% of par plus accrued interest at
private sale by the Director of
Finance to the Original Purchaser
in accordance with law and the provisions of this Ordinance. If, in the
reasonable opinion of the Director of
Finance, an underwriter is incapable of fully performing its duties
or meeting its obligations in its
capacity as Original Purchaser with
respect to the Notes, the Director of
Finance is hereby authorized and
directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever action may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser. The Director
of Finance shall sign the Certificate
of Award referred to in this Ordinance, evidencing that sale to the
Original Purchaser, cause the Notes
to be prepared, and have the Notes
signed and delivered, together with
a true transcript of proceedings
with reference to the issuance of the
Notes if requested by the Original
Purchaser, to the Original Purchaser upon payment of the purchase
price. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a note purchase agreement or agreements between the City and the
Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the “Purchase Agreement”), in a form consistent with
this Ordinance and as approved by
the Director of Law. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Notes to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose. The
Mayor, the Director of Finance, the
Clerk, the Director of Law, and
other City officials, as appropriate,
are each authorized and directed to
sign
any
transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 12. Security for the Notes.
The Notes are special obligations of
the City. The interest on the Notes,
unless paid from other sources available to the City, is secured solely
by, and is payable solely from Subordinated Airport Revenue.
The principal of the Notes, unless
paid from other sources available to
the City, is payable solely from the
proceeds of the Bonds. The City
covenants and agrees to do all
things
necessary
to
effect
the
issuance and delivery, prior to the
maturity of the Notes, of the Bonds
or any renewal notes, in that principal amount as may be necessary,
together with any other moneys

available to the City for the purpose, to pay the principal of the
Notes when due at maturity and to
do all things necessary to sell the
Bonds in sufficient time to permit
their delivery prior to the maturity
of the Notes. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Bonds
or of any renewal notes and any
excess funds resulting from the
issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used to pay the
debt charges on the Notes at maturity and are pledged for that purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the City covenants and agrees to
issue Additional Revenue Bonds as
defined in the Indenture to retire
the Notes which would be issued on
a
parity
with
Airport
Revenue
Bonds (as defined in the Indenture),
if and to the extent the City can satisfy the conditions precedent under
the Indenture for the issuance of
Additional Airport Revenue Bonds.
Further, if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of the Financial Advisor, that
under conditions of the market at
that time, the Bonds cannot be
issued with reasonable terms, the
City covenants and agrees that it
will issue obligations payable from
other City sources to retire the
Notes at maturity.
The City shall not be obligated to
pay principal of and interest on the
Notes from any funds or sources
other than those described in this
Section, and the Notes shall not be

The City will observe and perform
all its agreements and obligations

interest of and financially advantageous to the City, such trust agreement and fund or funds are hereby

of Finance, Director of Port Control
and other City officials, as appropriate, are authorized to take such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate such additional security for the Notes. Such trust
agreement may be supplemental to

balances
required

being issued. Any portion of the

deposit to a debt service reserve
fund created pursuant to Section 12
shall be paid into that debt service
reserve fund.

to the Notes under the Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data, audited financial statements
and notices, in such manner, as may
be required for purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of the Rule. In
order to describe and specify certain
terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose,
and
thereby
to
implement
that
agreement, including provisions for
enforcement, amendment, and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to sign and

to the annual appropriation of any
funds that may be necessary to perform it.

Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,

shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Section 15. Ratings, Insurance,

this City, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare and submit
those applications, to provide to
each such agency, company or other
credit enhancement facility provider
such information as may be required
for the purpose. The cost of obtaining each such rating, policy, bond or
credit enhancement facility, except
to the extent paid by the Original
Purchaser in accordance with the
Purchase Agreement, shall be paid
from the proceeds of the Notes.
Section 16. Interest Rate Swaps,
Hedges and Caps. For the purpose of
achieving the optimal available debt
structure for the Notes, the Director
of Finance may, based on the written advice of the Financial Advisor,
enter into one or more agreements in
connection with or subsequent to the
issuance of the Notes for an interest
rate swap, an interest rate cap or
other such arrangement to lower the
effective interest rate on the obligations to the City or to hedge the exposure of the City against fluctuations
in prevailing interest rates, provided,
however, that: (i) the debt structure
that is simulated through the combination of the Notes with any such
agreements shall comply with the
restrictions of this Ordinance on the
terms of and security for the Notes
applied to that structure as though it
consisted solely of Notes; (ii) the
counterparty to any swap agreement
and the provider of any interest rate
cap shall have a rating of at least
“A” by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or Standard & Poor’s Corporation; (iii) no such agreement
shall purport to entitle the counterparty to the agreement to payment
by the City from any source other
than the sources which secure the
Notes as described in this Ordinance;
(iv) the cost of obtaining any such
interest rate cap or other such
arrangement shall have been determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of the
Financial Advisor, to be justified by
the corresponding benefit to the City
and to be commercially reasonable
based on then current market conditions. The notional amount on which
any such agreement is based shall
not be subject to the limitations set
forth herein on the maximum principal amount of the Notes.
Section 17. Tax Covenants. The
City covenants that it will use, and
will restrict the use and investment
of, the proceeds of the Notes in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the Notes
will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149

of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii)
be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest on the
Notes will not be treated as an item
of tax preference under Section 57
of the Code.

(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required of
it for the interest on the Notes to be
and remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for
it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the
Notes to the governmental purpose of
the borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield
on investment property, (iii) make
timely and adequate payments to the
federal government, (iv) maintain
books and records and make calculations and reports and (v) refrain

fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes is hereby
authorized (a) to make or effect any
election,
selection,
designation,
choice, consent, approval, or waiver
on behalf of the City with respect
to the Notes as the City is permitted to or required to make or give
under the federal income tax laws,
including, without limitation thereto, any of the elections provided for
in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the Code
or available under Section 148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the Notes
or interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that
purpose, reducing the burden or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
or penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Notes, and (c) to
give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for inclusion in
the transcript of proceedings for the
Notes, setting forth the reasonable
expectations of the City regarding
the amount and use of all the proceeds of the Notes, the facts, circumstances and estimates on which
they are based, and other facts and
circumstances relevant to the tax
treatment of the interest on and the
tax status of the Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provisions of this Ordinance to the contrary, if the Director of Finance determines prior to
the execution and delivery of any
Purchase Agreement that it is necessary and appropriate and in the
best interests of the City for the
interest on the Notes to be included
in gross income for federal income
tax purposes, the City shall not be

bound by the covenants of this Section with respect to the Notes.

An emergency resolution urging
the Secretary of the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development
to reconsider and support the application for the Pick-Up, Assessment,
Shelter and Services (P.A.S.S.) Program
application
for
Supportive
Housing funds submitted by the
City of Cleveland/Cuyahoga County
Office of Homeless Services.
Whereas, on any given night,
there are 950 shelter beds or mats
on a floor available to homeless persons to sleep; and
Whereas, there are an estimated
12,000 persons who use the shelters
in the City of Cleveland at some
point in any given year, and
Whereas, there are an estimated
20,000 homeless persons who go
homeless in Cuyahoga County at
some point in any given year; and
Whereas,
the
Pick-Up,
Assessment, Shelter and Services (P.A.S.S.)
Program is a creative and necessary
component of the continuum of care
services
for
homeless
people
throughout Greater Cleveland; and
Whereas, the P.A.S.S. Program
serves 47 persons at a time, has
accommodated a total of 186 persons, and has had requests for service from 700 different persons; and
Whereas, the P.A.S.S. Program
effectively serves persons who are
homeless; encouraging people on the
street to break chemical addictions,
develop a positive work record; save
money, overcome psychological limitations and strive for self-sufficiency through a system of thoughtful
and successful social services; and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
Chapter of the Salvation Army has
been the faithful steward of HUD
Innovative Homeless Demonstration
Program (IHDP) funds by developing this program to serve some of
the most hard core homeless persons
in the Greater Cleveland community; and
Whereas,
the
City
of
Cleveland/Cuyahoga County Office of
Homeless Services is charged with
developing on-going funds for this
local IHDP program, and in communication with HUD staff determined the Supportive Housing Program (SHP) funds were most appropriate to seek for help; and
Whereas,
the
City
of
Cleveland/Cuyahoga County Office of
Homeless Services and HUD staff
discussed during the application
period that the P.A.S.S. Program
was not a new program, nor previously funded by Supporting Housing
Program funds and together decided to apply for “renewal” funding
within the SHP; and
Whereas, the Secretary of the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban
Development identified in a letter to
the City of Cleveland dated May
28th, 1998 that the Supporting Housing Program is a potential source of
funds specifically for the continuation of the P.A.S.S. Program and further enclosed the Notice of Funding
Availability (NOFA) to assist the
City to apply for funds in this
regard; and
Whereas,
the
City
of
Cleveland/Cuyahoga County Office
of Homeless Services consequently
applied
for
Supportive
Housing
Funds for the P.A.S.S. Program; and

Whereas, a HUD rule forbids
applicants for funds to communicate
with HUD staff after an application
is submitted for review and before
it is approved or denied by HUD
even to discuss complex application
circumstances such as these; and
Whereas, on December 23rd, 1998
HUD announced the awards for Supportive
Housing
Program
funds
which did NOT include funds for the
P.A.S.S. program because it had not
previously received SHP funds; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland.
Section 1. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby strongly encourages
the Secretary of the U.S. Departm e n t
of Housing and Urban Dev elopment to reconsider and support the
application of the Pick-Up, Assessment, Shelter and Services (P.A.S.S.)
Program application for Supportive
Housing funds submitted by the

By Councilmen Westbrook and

An emergency ordinance to authorize the issuance and sale of subordinated airport revenue notes in the
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed $40,000,000, in anticipation of
the issuance of bonds, to pay costs
of acquiring real property and interests in real property for the purpose
of improving the Airport System,
and related matters.
Whereas, this Council has determined that, in order to timely
respond to the increasing demand
for air service at Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport, and to plan
for future demands for air service,
it is necessary to acquire neighboring property to increase the Airport
site, with the desired consequence of
increasing the capacity of Airport
operations; and
Whereas, that acquisition will provide needed property for the provision of air services to the public,
and the prompt commencement of
the acquisition requires the issuance
of the subordinated revenue notes
authorized hereunder and the undertaking of the transactions contemplated herein, and it is necessary to
issue such notes as soon as possible
to take advantage of favorable conditions in the financial markets,

Notes (as defined in Section 3

be payable semiannually until the
principal amount is paid The Bonds
are estimated to mature in 25 annual principal installments that are in

retired from the proceeds of obligations issued other than the Bonds or
from other moneys available for

Obligations shall bear such terms as
are authorized by this Council in a

their issuance.
Section 3. Issuance of Notes. It is
necessary for the reasons set forth
in the preambles to this Ordinance,
and this Council determines, that
notes in the aggregate principal
amount not to exceed $40,000,000
(the “Notes”) shall be issued in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds, the proceeds of which will
be used to pay costs of the Project,
to pay costs of any Credit Support
Instrument
with respect
to
the
Notes, to fund any debt service
reserve fund established under Section 12, and to pay costs of issuance
of the Notes. The Notes shall be
issued in the aggregate principal
amount not to exceed $40,000,000
that is determined by the Director
of Finance in the Certificate of
Award to be required to be issued
for the purposes stated above in

this Section, taking into account
other moneys available for such
purposes. The Notes may be issued
from time to time in one or more
series if so provided in the Certificate of Award, provided that a separate Certificate of Award shall be
executed for each series and the
last series of Notes shall be awarded and sold no later than December
31, 2000. The Notes of each series
shall be dated the date of issuance
of the respective series or such
other date as is designated in the
Certificate of Award, provided that
such date shall be no later than
December 31, 2000. The Notes of
each series shall mature on a date
to be determined by the Director of
Finance in the Certificate of Award
in accordance with his determination of the best interest of and
financial advantages to the City,
provided that such date shall not be
later than two years from the date
of issuance of the respective series
of Notes.
Section 4. Interest. The Notes of
each series shall bear interest from
the date of the respective series at
the rate per annum set forth in the
Certificate of Award, or if any
Notes bear interest at a variable
rate, at the rate determined pursuant to the method set forth in the
Certificate of Award. Interest on
the Notes shall be payable on the
dates determined by the Director of
Finance in the Certificate of Award
and until the principal amount is
paid or payment is provided for. If
any Notes bear interest at a fixed
rate, that rate shall not exceed six
and one-half percent (6-1/2%) per
year (computed on the basis of a
360-day year consisting of twelve
30-day months) and interest shall
be payable not more often than
every six months and at maturity
or at any earlier redemption date.
If any Notes bear interest at a variable rate or rates, those rates shall
not exceed that set forth in Section
5, and interest shall be payable not
more often than once a month and
following purchase and at maturity or at any earlier redemption
date.
Section 5. Variable Rate Notes. In
the event that the Director of
Finance determines that the City’s
best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Notes
to be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
so specify in the Certificate of
Award. If the Director of Finance so
determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Notes shall be determined,
whether by reference to a market
index, by a remarketing agent or
otherwise; provided that the variable rate Notes shall not bear interest at a rate in excess of twelve percent (12%) per annum. That maximum interest rate shall not apply to
variable rate Notes during any period those Notes are held by a
provider of a Credit Support Instrument because they could not be
remarketed and the terms of the
Credit Support Instrument do not
permit such a maximum rate of
interest. Holders of variable rate
Notes may be given the right to ten-

der their variable rate Notes for purchase by the City at the times, on
the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and any tender agreement;
provided that tender rights shall be
exercisable only at such times as a
Credit Support Instrument is in
place that provides for the payment
of the purchase price payable to the
tendering holder of a variable rate
Note. If the Director of Finance designates any Notes as variable rate
Notes, and if the holders of the variable rate Notes are to be entitled to
tender the variable rate Notes for
purchase,
then
the
Director
of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate Notes the provider or
providers for any Credit Support
Instrument, the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Notes,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the variable rate Notes are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support
Instruments,
tender
agents (which may be the Registrar), remarketing agents, and others as may be determined by the
Director of Finance to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders
the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of the variable rate Notes upon
tender for purchase or redemption,
and providing for the repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn
under the Credit Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
the Notes, and regardless of the
Notes bearing interest at variable or
fixed rates, is authorized to contract
for a Credit Support Instrument, and
to pay the costs of it from proceeds
of the Notes, if he determines that
the Credit Support Instrument will
result in a savings in the cost of
this financing to the City.
Section
6.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges on the Notes; Redemption.
The debt charges on the Notes shall
be payable in lawful money of the
United States of America, or in Federal Reserve funds of the United
States of America as determined by
the Director of Finance in the Certificate of Award, and shall be
payable, without deduction for services of the Registrar (as defined in
Section 7) as the City’s paying
agent. If agreed to by the Original
Purchaser, the Notes shall be subject to redemption without penalty
or premium at the option of the City
in whole or in part at any time prior
to maturity as provided in this Ordinance.
If fewer than all of the outstanding Notes are called for optional
redemption at one time and Notes of
more than one maturity are then
outstanding, the Notes that are
called shall be called as selected by,
and selected in a manner determined by, the City. If fewer than all

of the Notes of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Notes
of
that
maturity
to
be
redeemed, or portions thereof in
amounts of the minimum authorized
denomination or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by lot in
a manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Notes by lot when Notes of
denominations greater than the minimum authorized denomination are
then outstanding, each unit of principal thereof in the amount of the
minimum authorized denomination
shall be treated as if it were a separate Note of the denomination of
the minimum authorized denomination. If it is determined that one or
more, but not all, of the units of
principal amount in the amount of
the minimum authorized denomination represented by a Note are to be
called for redemption, then, upon
notice of redemption of such unit or
units, the registered owner of that
Note shall surrender the Note to the
Registrar (i) for payment of the
redemption price of such unit or
units of principal amount called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption), and (ii)
for issuance, without charge to the
registered owner, of a new Note or
Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Note surrendered.
The notice of the call for redemption of Notes shall identify (i) by
designation, letters, numbers, or
other
distinguishing
marks, the
Notes or portions thereof to be
redeemed, (ii) the redemption price
to be paid, (iii) the date fixed for
redemption, and (iv) the place or
places where the amounts due upon
redemption are payable. The notice
shall be given by the Registrar on
behalf of the City by mailing a
copy of the redemption notice by
first class mail, postage prepaid, at
least 30 days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Note subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Note Register (as
defined in Section 7) maintained by
the Registrar at the close of business on the 15th day preceding that
mailing. Failure to receive notice
by mail or any defect in that notice
regarding any Note, however, shall
not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any
Note.
In
the
event
that
notice
of
redemption shall have been given
by the Registrar to the registered
owners as provided above, there
shall be deposited with the Registrar on or prior to the redemption
date, moneys that, in addition to
any other moneys available therefor
and held by the Registrar, will be
sufficient to redeem at the redemption price thereof, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date, all
of the redeemable Notes for which
notice
of
redemption
has
been
given. Notice having been mailed in
the manner provided in the preceding paragraph hereof, the Notes and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the

redemption
price,
plus
accrued
interest to the redemption date. If
moneys for the redemption of all of
the Notes and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with accrued
interest thereon to the redemption
date, are held by the Registrar on
the redemption date, so as to be
available therefor on that date and,
if notice of redemption has been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
those moneys shall not be so available on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Notes and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All moneys
held by
the Registrar for the
redemption of particular Notes shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Notes.
Section 7. Registrar. The Director
of Finance shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent, and paying agent for
the Notes after determining that the
payment at that bank or trust company will not endanger the funds or
securities of the City and that proper procedures and safeguards are
available for that purpose (the
“Registrar”).
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a registrar agreement or agreements between the City and the
Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”) in a form consistent with
this Ordinance and as approved by
the Director of Law. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Notes to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose.
The Notes shall be issued only as
fully registered Notes. Principal on
the Notes shall be payable when due
upon presentation and surrender of
the Notes at the designated office of
the Registrar designated in the Registrar Agreement. Interest on each
Note shall be paid on each interest
payment date by check or draft
mailed to the person in whose name
the Note was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing on the
Note Register (defined below in this
Section) at the close of business on
the 15th day of the calendar month
next preceding that interest payment date. The City will cause the
Registrar to maintain and keep all
books and records necessary for the
registration, exchange, and transfer
of Notes as provided in this Section
(the “Note Register”) so long as any
of the Notes remain outstanding.
Subject to the provisions of this Section, the person in whose name a
Note is registered on the Note Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Note for all
purposes of the Note Proceedings.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of

that person; neither the City nor the
Registrar shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary, but the registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
and so long as the Notes are issued
in a book entry system, principal of
and interest on the Notes shall be
payable in the manner provided in
any agreement entered into by the
Director of Finance, in the name
and on behalf of the City, in connection with the book entry system.
Section 8. Transfer and Exchange
of Certain Notes. Notes may be
exchanged for Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the office designated by the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
office designated by the Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
Upon exchange or transfer, the Registrar shall complete, authenticate,
and deliver a new Note or Notes of
the same series, of any authorized
denomination or authorized denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
the Note Proceedings. The exchange
or transfer shall be without charge
to the owner, except that the City
and Registrar may make a charge
sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
special obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under the Note Proceedings, as the
Notes
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer. Neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
required to make any exchange or
transfer of a Note during the period
beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the
mailing of a notice of redemption of
Notes and ending at the close of
business on the day of such mailing
or to transfer or exchange any Note
selected for redemption in whole or
in part.
Section 9. Book Entry. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Ordinance, if it is determined

by the Director of Finance to be in
the best interests of and financially
advantageous to the City, the Notes
may be issued in book entry form
in accordance with the provisions of
this Section. As used in this Section
and this Ordinance:
The Notes may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized, (i)
the Notes may be issued in the
form of a single, fully registered
Note representing each maturity
and registered in the name of the
Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in
the custody of the Depository; (ii)
the book entry interest owners of
Notes in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Notes in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of book
entry interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on
the system maintained and operated by the Depository and its Participants, and transfers of the ownership of book entry interests shall
be made only by book entry by the
Depository and its Participants;
and (iv) the Notes as such shall
not be transferable or exchangeable, except for transfer to another Depository or to another nominee of a Depository, without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Notes for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Director of Finance, after
making provision for notification of
the book entry interest owners by
the then Depository and any other
arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the
Notes from the Depository, and
authenticate and deliver note certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance also is
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the Notes,
after determining that the signing
thereof will not endanger the funds
or securities of the City and after
the approval of the form of any
such agreement by the Director of
Law.
Section 10. Execution of Notes.
Notes shall be signed by the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, in the
name of the City and in their official capacities, provided that either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile, and shall bear the seal
of the City or a facsimile thereof;
provided that no Note shall be valid
or obligatory for any purpose or
shall be entitled to any security or
benefit under the Note Proceedings
unless and until the certificate of
authentication printed on the Note is
signed by the Registrar as authenticating agent, and authentication
by the Registrar shall be conclusive
evidence that the Note so authenticated has been duly issued, signed
and delivered under, and is entitled

to the security and benefit of, the
Note Proceedings. The certificate of
authentication may be signed by
any authorized officer or employee
of the Registrar or by any other person acting as an agent of the Registrar and approved by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the City.
The same person need not sign the
certificate of authentication on all
of the Notes.
Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Notes and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature. The
Notes shall be issued in the denominations as requested by the Original Purchaser and approved by the
Director of Finance, in conformity
with this Ordinance. The entire
principal amount may be represented by a single note and may be
issued as fully registered securities
and in book entry or other uncertificated form if it is determined by
the
Director
of
Finance
that
issuance of fully registered securities in that form will facilitate the
sale and delivery of the Notes. The
Notes may be issued in the authorized denominations of either (a)
$100,000 each or in any denomination that is the sum of (i) $100,000
and (ii) $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and not exchangeable
for other Notes in denominations
less than $100,000, or (b) $5,000 or
any integral multiple thereof, as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Certificate of Award
to be in the best interests of the
City. The Notes shall not have
coupons attached, shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance and shall express upon
their faces the purpose, in summary terms, for which they are issued
and that they are issued pursuant
to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Sale of Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at not less than
97% of par plus accrued interest at
private sale by the Director of
Finance to the Original Purchaser
in accordance with law and the provisions of this Ordinance. If, in the
reasonable opinion of the Director of
Finance, an underwriter is incapable of fully performing its duties
or meeting its obligations in its
capacity as Original Purchaser with
respect to the Notes, the Director of
Finance is hereby authorized and
directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever action may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser. The Director
of Finance shall sign the Certificate
of Award referred to in this Ordinance, evidencing that sale to the
Original Purchaser, cause the Notes
to be prepared, and have the Notes
signed and delivered, together with
a true transcript of proceedings
with reference to the issuance of the
Notes if requested by the Original
Purchaser, to the Original Purchaser upon payment of the purchase
price. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a note purchase agreement or agreements between the City and the
Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the “Purchase Agreement”), in a form consistent with
this Ordinance and as approved by
the Director of Law. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the pay-

ment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Notes to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose. The
Mayor, the Director of Finance, the
Clerk, the Director of Law, and
other City officials, as appropriate,
are each authorized and directed to
sign
any
transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 12. Security for the Notes.
The Notes are special obligations of
the City. The interest on the Notes,
unless paid from other sources available to the City, is secured solely
by, and is payable solely from Subordinated Airport Revenue.
The principal of the Notes, unless
paid from other sources available to
the City, is payable solely from the
proceeds of the Bonds. The City
covenants and agrees to do all
things
necessary
to
effect
the
issuance and delivery, prior to the
maturity of the Notes, of the Bonds
or any renewal notes, in that principal amount as may be necessary,
together with any other moneys
available to the City for the purpose, to pay the principal of the
Notes when due at maturity and to
do all things necessary to sell the
Bonds in sufficient time to permit
their delivery prior to the maturity
of the Notes. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Bonds
or of any renewal notes and any
excess funds resulting from the
issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used to pay the
debt charges on the Notes at maturity and are pledged for that purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the City covenants and agrees to
issue Additional Revenue Bonds as
defined in the Indenture to retire
the Notes which would be issued on
a
parity
with
Airport
Revenue
Bonds (as defined in the Indenture),
if and to the extent the City can satisfy the conditions precedent under
the Indenture for the issuance of
Additional Airport Revenue Bonds.
Further, if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of the Financial Advisor, that
under conditions of the market at
that time, the Bonds cannot be
issued with reasonable terms, the
City covenants and agrees that it
will issue obligations payable from
other City sources to retire the
Notes at maturity.
The City shall not be obligated to
pay principal of and interest on the
Notes from any funds or sources
other than those described in this
Section, and the Notes shall not be
a claim upon or lien against any
other property of the City. The
Notes, as to both principal and interest, are not general obligations of
the City, and the full faith and credit of the City is not pledged to their
payment. The holders of the Notes
shall have no right to have taxes
levied by the City for the payment
of principal of and interest on the
Notes.
Nothing
herein,
however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the City,
of its own volition, from using, to

the extent that it is authorized by
law to do so, any other resources for
the fulfillment of any of the terms,
conditions, or obligations of this
Ordinance or of the Notes.
The City will observe and perform
all its agreements and obligations
provided for by the Notes or this
Ordinance. All of the obligations
under this Ordinance are hereby
established as duties specifically
enjoined by law and resulting from
an office, trust, or station upon the
City within the meaning of Section
2731.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, after consultation
with the Financial Advisor, a trust
agreement providing, among other
things, for the holding in trust by a
bank of a debt service fund, debt
service reserve fund or similar fund
to secure the Notes is in the best
interest of and financially advantageous to the City, such trust agreement and fund or funds are hereby
authorized and the Mayor, Director
of Finance, Director of Port Control
and other City officials, as appropriate, are authorized to take such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate such additional security for the Notes. Such trust
agreement may be supplemental to
the Indenture. The City hereby
covenants and agrees to appropriate
annually from the Subordinated Airport Revenue into any such funds
amounts sufficient to maintain the
balances
required
by
the
trust
agreement and to restore any deficiency therein.
Section 13. Note Proceeds. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes,
except any premium and accrued
interest and except any portion of
the proceeds representing a required
deposit to a debt service reserve fund
created pursuant to Section 12, shall
be paid into the proper fund or funds
and those proceeds are appropriated
and shall be used for the purpose for
which the Notes are being issued.
Any portion of the proceeds representing a required deposit to a debt
service reserve fund created pursuant to Section 12 shall be paid into
that debt service reserve fund.
Section 14. Disclosure. If, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
after consultation with the Financial Advisor and the Original Purchaser, an official statement or
other disclosure document is appropriate relating to the initial offering
of
the
Notes,
the
Director
of
Finance, on behalf of the City and
in that officer’s official capacity, is
authorized to (i) cooperate with the
Original Purchaser in the preparation of, and the making of modifications, completions or changes of
or supplements to, such a disclosure
document, (ii) determine, and to certify or otherwise represent, when
the disclosure document is to be
deemed final or is final, (iii) authorize the use and distribution of that
disclosure document and any supplements thereto in connection with
the initial offering of the Notes, and
(iv) sign certificates, statements or
other documents in connection with
the finality, accuracy, and completeness of that disclosure document.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes, the City agrees, as the
only obligated person with respect

to the Notes under the Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data, audited financial statements
and notices, in such manner, as may
be required for purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of the Rule. In
order to describe and specify certain
terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose,
and
thereby
to
implement
that
agreement, including provisions for

recognized rating agencies, (ii) a
policy of insurance or other credit
enhancement facility from a company or companies to better assure
the payment of principal of and
interest on the Notes, or (iii) a
surety bond or other credit enhancement facility from a company or
other companies to satisfy any

policy, bond or credit enhancement
facility, except to the extent paid
by the Original Purchaser in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, shall be paid from the proceeds of the Notes.
Section 16. Interest Rate Swaps,
Hedges and Caps. For the purpose
of achieving the optimal available
debt structure for the Notes, the
Director of Finance may, based on
the written advice of the Financial
Advisor, enter into one or more

agreements in connection with or
subsequent to the issuance of the
Notes for an interest rate swap, an
interest rate cap or other such
arrangement to lower the effective
interest rate on the obligations to
the City or to hedge the exposure of
the City against fluctuations in prevailing interest rates, provided, however, that: (i) the debt structure that
is simulated through the combination of the Notes with any such
agreements shall comply with the
restrictions of this Ordinance on the
terms of and security for the Notes
applied to that structure as though
it consisted solely of Notes; (ii) the
counterparty to any swap agreement
and the provider of any interest rate
cap shall have a rating of at least
“A” by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or Standard & Poor’s Corporation; (iii) no such agreement
shall purport to entitle the counterparty to the agreement to payment
by the City from any source other
than the sources which secure the
Notes as described in this Ordinance;
(iv) the cost of obtaining any such
interest rate cap or other such
arrangement shall have been determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of the
Financial Advisor, to be justified by
the corresponding benefit to the
City and to be commercially reasonable based on then current market conditions. The notional amount
on which any such agreement is
based shall not be subject to the
limitations set forth herein on the
maximum principal amount of the
Notes.
Section 17. Tax Covenants. The
City covenants that it will use, and
will restrict the use and investment
of, the proceeds of the Notes in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the Notes
will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii)
be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest on the
Notes will not be treated as an item
of tax preference under Section 57
of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes to
be and remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting
for it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Notes to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds, and, as applicable,

Code.

or available under Section 148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the Notes
or interest thereon or assisting

as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations, make payments, and make or
give reports, covenants and certifications of and on behalf of the City,
as may be appropriate to assure the
exclusion of interest from gross
income and the intended tax status
of the Notes, and (c) to give one or
more appropriate certificates of the
City, for inclusion in the transcript
of proceedings for the Notes, setting
forth the reasonable expectations of
the City regarding the amount and
use of all the proceeds of the Notes,
the facts, circumstances and estimates on which they are based, and
other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provisions of this Ordinance to the contrary, if the Director of Finance determines prior to
the execution and delivery of any
Purchase Agreement that it is necessary and appropriate and in the
best interests of the City for the
interest on the Notes to be included in gross income for federal
income tax purposes, the City shall
not be bound by the covenants of
this Section with respect to the
Notes.
