Res. No. 152-99.
By Councilmen Willis and Cintron.
An emergency resolution urging
the Regional Transit Authority to
continue usage of buses fueled by
compressed natural gas and to conduct further studies prior to purchasing diesel powered vehicles.
Whereas, the Regional Transit
Authority (RTA) buses provide service to thousands of passengers in
and around the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, in a progressive effort
to ensure a cleaner environment,
RTA became a leader in the transit
industry by purchasing and using
buses powered by natural gas, as
opposed to diesel buses; and
Whereas, diesel powered buses
release a greater number of carcinogenic particulates than buses
powered by CNG; and
Whereas, RTA currently has 166
buses, or 22 percent of its fleet,
which are powered by compressed
natural gas (CNG); and
Whereas, RTA is considering the
suspension of purchase and use of
CNG powered buses in favor of
increased use of diesel buses; and
Whereas, discontinuance of buses
fueled by CNG would adversely
impact the air quality of the City of
Cleveland
and
could
negatively
impair the health of the residents of
our neighborhoods; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges RTA to continue its progressive efforts to purchase and utilize buses powered by
compressed natural gas and requests that RTA be mindful of the
impact that diesel fuel has on the

conduct further studies of the costs
and benefits of use of buses fueled
by compressed natural gas before
purchasing additional diesel powered buses.

Whereas, food that would otherwise be wasted is provided to hungry men, women and children; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
