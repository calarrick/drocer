of Cleveland recognizes the historical significance and the need to
commemorate Juneteenth as a holiday in the City of Cleveland, with
emphasis to be placed on education
of our youth about the history and
legacy of slavery; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland urges Governor Taft
and the Ohio General Assembly to
