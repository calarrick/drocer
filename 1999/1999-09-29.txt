Res. No. 271-99.
By Councilman Melena (by request).
An emergency resolution declaring the intention to vacate a portion
of West 76th Street.
Whereas, this Council; is satisfied
that there is good cause to vacate
all that portion of West 76th Street
as hereinafter described, and

September 29, 1999
Whereas, this resolution constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it hereby declares
its intention to vacate all those portions of the following described real
property:
Situated in the City of Cleveland,
County of Cuyahoga and State of
Ohio, and known as being all that
portion of:
WEST 76TH STREET (20.00 feet
wide) extending Northerly from the
Northerly line of Lorain Avenue
(66.00 feet wide) to the Southerly
line of Colgate Court (14.00 feet
wide).
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted September 20, 1999.
Effective September 27, 1999.
Res. No. 1585-99.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
Congress to adopt legislation to
ensure the provisions of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965 remain in place
permanently.
Whereas, the 15th amendment to
the United States Constitution prohibits racial discrimination in voting; and
Whereas, to ensure that this constitutional requirement was upheld,
Congress enacted the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 to address the widespread discrimination that existed
in many areas of the country where
African Americans were not permitted to vote, and those who registered to vote or assisted in registering others to vote risked losing
their jobs, their homes and even
their lives; and
Whereas, the Voting Rights Act of
1965 provided, among other things,
for federal registrars to register
voters in certain areas, federal monitors for elections, and prohibited
the creation of voting procedures
that were racially discriminatory;
and
Whereas, the provisions of the
Voting Rights Act were extended in
1970, 1975 and 1982 and are now
scheduled to expire in 2007, if not
further extended; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland abhors racial discrimination in all forms, and particularly with respect to the ability to vote
since that right is the cornerstone
of our democracy; and
Whereas, the United States Congress should enact a measure that
ensures that the mechanisms to
monitor discrimination in voting
established by the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 will remain in effect permanently; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges Congress to
enact legislation that will ensure
that the procedures to monitor and
prevent discrimination in voting
established by the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 will remain in effect permanently, and not be subject to periodic review by Congress.

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

Whereas, in accordance with Charter Section 190, effective November
9, 1931, and the powers granted to
the City pursuant to the Constitution of the State of Ohio, the Council of the City of Cleveland has
enacted numerous ordinances regulating
the
public

but not limited to, Chapters 503, 507,
508, 509, 521, 523, 531, 535, 541, 543,

in accordance with Chapter 35 of the

Whereas, the Council unanimously approved Resolution No. 1175-99
on June 14, 1999, urging the State
General Assembly to reject H.B. 283
which would usurp local home rule
powers and would limit the authority of municipalities to regulate and
charge fees for the use of its rightsof-way by public utilities, communication providers and cable television
companies; and
Whereas, the state legislature
nevertheless enacted Revised Code
Sections 4939.01 - 4939.04 on June 30,
1999 which limit the City’s ability to
control, regulate and assess fees for
the use of its right-of-way; and
Whereas, the Council considers
this measure to be unconstitutional
and violative of the City’s right,
duty and obligation to maintain and
protect the public right-of-way in a
safe and efficient manner; and
Whereas, the Council has and will
continue
to
exercise
its
rights,
duties and obligations to regulate
the public right-of-way in the best
interest of the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the City
of Cleveland; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

regulate, control and maintain the
public right-of-way in the municipal
boundaries of the City of Cleveland.
