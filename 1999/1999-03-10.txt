of Cleveland recognizes and takes
great pride in this diversity and the
benefits that it brings to all residents of the City; and
Whereas, the Council acknowledges an unfortunate and unacceptable increase in outward manifestations of racial, cultural and linguistic intolerance which is often
accompanied by violent acts that
threaten the public safety and welfare; and

diversity is evident in H.B. 94, currently pending before the Ohio legislature, that requires that the English language be used in the official
actions and proceedings of state
agencies and political subdivisions;
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland welcomes all residents and celebrates racial, cultural and language diversity as evidence of the great pluralistic tradition and history of our city and
nation.
Section 2. That this Council is
opposed to House Bill 94 and other
similar legislative initiatives that
discourage diversity and promote
misunderstanding and isolation of
divergent cultures and this Council
further urges state legislators to
oppose H.B. 94.
Section 3. That the Clerk is hereby requested to forward a copy of
this Resolution to JoAnn Davidson,
Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives and to Dennis Dove,
Director of Community Relations for

officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the

respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 340-99.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
HUD to demolish the Belvoir-Cliffs
apartment building and to grant
title to the property to the City of
Cleveland for compatible neighborhood development.
Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) owns the Belvoir-Cliffs, a 160
unit apartment building, located at
the intersection of Belvoir Blvd. and
Cliffview Road in the Euclid Park
community of the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, HUD was forced to
assume ownership and control of the
building because its previous owner
let the property fall into severe disrepair, as evidenced by numerous
significant code violations and its
very low occupancy rate; and
Whereas, Belvoir-Cliffs has become a haven for illegal drug activities and prostitution, presenting a
profound safety risk to the surrounding neighborhood; and

Whereas, the configuration of the
buildings lacks recreational and
structural amenities and presents a
barracks-like appearance, detracting
from the aesthetic appearance of the
neighborhood
and
making
it
markedly different from the surrounding ranch-style houses; and
Whereas, the citizens of the community, in the interest of safety and
well-being
of
the
neighborhood,
have expressed their desire to have
the facility demolished, as opposed
to HUD performing a cosmetic alteration of the apartment building;
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges HUD to act
in the best interest of the residents
of the City of Cleveland and to
demolish the Belvoir-Cliffs apartment building, as it unsafe and
undesirable for low income housing.
Section 2. That, upon demolition of
Belvoir-Cliffs, HUD grant title to the
property to the City of Cleveland so
that it may be developed in a use
that is compatible with and meets
the needs of the surrounding community.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this Resolution to Andrew
Cuomo, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; Mayor Michael White; and
Linda Hudecek, Director of Community Development.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 1, 1999.
Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.
Res. No. 341-99.
By Councilman Patmon.
An emergency resolution objecting to the issuance of a C1 Liquor
Permit to 970 Lakeview Rd.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Director of Liquor Control

issuance of a C1 Liquor Permit to
Permit No. 4980630, Lakeview Supermarket
II
Inc.,
DBA
Lakeview
Superette, 970 Lakeview Rd., Cleveland, Ohio 44108; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best
interests of the entire community;
and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and

Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby
record
its
objection
to
the
issuance of a C1 Liquor Permit to
Permit No. 4980630, Lakeview Supermarket
II

accordance with provisions of Section 4303.26 of the Revised Code of
Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
