Avenue, by and through its President.
RECITALS:
1. FH has operated a hospital in
the West Park neighborhood of the
City of Cleveland since 1955. FH
desires to modernize and expand its
facility by constructing and operating the ParkView Patient Care Center, a 171,000 square foot facility
linked to the existing hospital facility (“FH Expansion Project”).

Campus Plan; it is the intention of
the parties to seek legislation authorizing the agreements and pledges
set forth herein.
In consideration of the foregoing
and the mutual promises contained
herein, the parties hereto agree as
follows:
1. Residential Parcel Acquisitions.
FH will acquire two residential
parcels, located at the corner of
Riverside
Road
and
Fernshaw
Avenue, known as Permanent Parcel Nos. 026-02-024 and 026-02-026, at
fair market value. FH shall relocate
or remove all structures on the property necessary for the construction
of a cul-de-sac at the westerly terminus of Fernshaw Avenue and
shall convey to the City such portions of the parcels as may be necessary for the cul-de-sac as discussed in paragraph 2 herein. Title
to all portions of PPNs. 026-02-024
and 026-02-026 not needed for the
construction and maintenance of the
cul-de-sacs shall be transferred to
the City of Cleveland’s Land Bank;
FH shall ensure that the garage of
PPN. 026-02-024 remains intact and is
conveyed to the City.
2. Cul-de-sacs. FH shall construct
a cul-de-sac, at their sole expense, at
the westerly terminus of Fernshaw
Avenue and shall construct, at their
sole expense, a cul-de-sac at the
northerly terminus of Riveredge
Road. Construction of the cul-de-sacs
shall commence immediately upon
receipt of the necessary City permits, which shall be obtained within 60 days of acquisition of the property, unless delayed by the City;
shall be completed no later than 60
days following commencement of
construction; shall be in conformance with all City requirements;
and shall conform with the Campus
Plan in all respects.

3. In order to implement the Campus Plan, the parties have made certain pledges concerning the issues
of zoning, traffic circulation and
parking.

3. Parking Facility. FH, immediately upon receipt of the necessary
permits from the City, shall immediately expand the existing parking
lot on FH property along Riveredge
Road to a total of 400 spaces, inclusive of the spaces within the existing lot. The parties acknowledge
that, subsequent to 2001, FH may
seek to expand the Parking Facility by an additional 400 spaces, for
a combined total of approximately
800 spaces. The parties agree that
such additional parking shall be
constructed below grade and within
the existing property line, with the
surface lot to remain at no more
than 400 spaces. FH shall place
restrictions of the Parking Facility
to prohibit the surface of any parking deck from exceeding a height of
five (5) feet above the crown of
Riveredge Road. The parties agree
that no ingress or egress to the
parking facility shall be planned,
developed, constructed, maintained
and/or permitted along the southern, eastern, or western boundaries
of the parking facility. Ingress
and/or egress to the parking facility shall be planned, developed, constructed, maintained and/or permitted solely from Old Lorain Road, via
a private access road adjacent to
the cul-de-sac to be constructed at
the westerly terminus of Fernshaw
Avenue, as identified in Exhibit A.

desire to
standing
ative to

4. Street Vacation. The City will
vacate portions of Riveredge Road
and Fernshaw Avenue for the construction, maintenance and opera-

other neighborhood concerns, additional parking and roadway reconfigurations are necessary. Such FH
Expansion Project and neighborhood concerns have been addressed
in a comprehensive plan (“Campus
Plan”), developed by the hospital
with consultation from the community. The Campus Plan, attached
hereto as Exhibit A, maximizes use
of hospital owned property, while at
the same time buffering adjacent
neighborhoods — thereby increasing
homes values and improving the
quality of life in the neighborhood
by eliminating nonresidential traffic. The Campus Plan also relieves
the burden placed on the municipal
parking facility at Kamms Corner
by hospital employees.

City of Cleveland and FH
set forth below the underthat has been reached relthe implementation of the

649

12
tion by FH of a private access road
to the Parking Facility. The City
will also vacate Groveland Court as
consideration
for
the
covenants
herein.
5. Old Lorain Road Improvements.
FH shall regrade and adjust Old

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 340-99.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
HUD to demolish the Belvoir-Cliffs
apartment building and to grant
title to the property to the City of
Cleveland for compatible neighborhood development.

April 21, 1999

The City Record

Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) owns the Belvoir-Cliffs, a 160
unit apartment building, located at
the intersection of Belvoir Blvd. and
Cliffview Road in the Euclid Park
community of the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, HUD was forced to
assume ownership and control of
the building because its previous
owner let the property fall into
severe disrepair, as evidenced by
numerous significant code violations and its very low occupancy
rate; and
Whereas, Belvoir-Cliffs has become a haven for illegal drug activities and prostitution, presenting a
profound safety risk to the surrounding neighborhood; and
Whereas, the configuration of
the buildings lacks recreational
and structural amenities and presents a barracks-like appearance,
detracting
from
the
aesthetic
appearance of the neighborhood
and making it markedly different
from the surrounding ranch-style
houses; and
Whereas, the citizens of the community, in the interest of safety and
well-being
of
the
neighborhood,
have expressed their desire to have
the facility demolished, as opposed
to HUD performing a cosmetic alteration of the apartment building;
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges HUD to act
in the best interest of the residents
of the City of Cleveland and to
demolish the Belvoir-Cliffs apartment building, as it unsafe and
undesirable for low income housing.
Section 2. That, upon demolition of
Belvoir-Cliffs, HUD grant title to the
property to the City of Cleveland so
that it may be developed in a use
that is compatible with and meets
the needs of the surrounding community.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this Resolution to Andrew
Cuomo, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; Mayor Michael White; and
Linda Hudecek, Director of Community Development.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 1, 1999.
Effective March 10, 1999, without
the signature of the Mayor.

already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby
record
its
objection
to

An emergency resolution urging
state officials and legislators to
take certain actions to strengthen
the services and effectiveness of
Medicaid HMOs.
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland is greatly concerned
with the health, safety and welfare
of Cleveland residents, particularly
families and children; and
Whereas, the first priority of
Ohio’s Medicaid system must be to
ensure high quality health care for
families and children who participate in the program; and
Whereas, participants in Cuyahoga County’s Medicaid HMO have
expressed various concerns about
health care available to people with
Medicaid
HMOs;
such
concerns
include confusing and inaccurate
billing; difficulty accessing referrals, medication and the emergency
room; and a lack of access to health
care for low and middle income
working parents; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about the collapse of Personal Physician Care (PPC) and the
problems faced by its former subscribers due to its collapse; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

Res. No. 605-99.
By Councilmen Cimperman, Willis
and Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
AT&T to refrain from implementing
a minimum monthly charge for long
distance telephone calls.
Whereas, AT&T has approximately 70 million long distance customers, many of whom are elderly,
poor or living on a fixed income;
and
Whereas,
AT&T
recently
announced its intention to implement
a $3.00 monthly charge to long distance
customers
regardless
of
whether any long distance telephone
calls have been made, effective July,
1999; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is opposed to the proposed
$3.00
monthly
minimum
charge for long distance subscribers
as it negatively impacts many residents of the City of Cleveland and
places an undue financial burden on
them; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges AT&T to
reconsider its proposed policy of
implementing
a
$3.00
minimum
monthly charge to long distance
subscribers regardless of whether
any long distance telephone calls
have been made and urges state and
federal representatives to join with
this Council in voicing opposition to
this burdensome tax.

a copy of this resolution to the following: Senator George Voinovich;
Senator
Mike
DeWine;
Governor
Robert Taft; Congressmen Dennis
Kucinich and Steve Latourette; Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs-Jones

An emergency resolution recognizing the necessity for strong
MBE/FBE programs and urging
opposition to proposed state legislation that would discontinue such
programs.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland recognizes that minority and female businesses have historically been at an extreme disadvantage in seeking business opportunities; and
Whereas, the Council applauds the
goal of Minority and Female Business Enterprise programs to encourage, promote and safeguard the viability and strength of minority and
female businesses; and
Whereas, the Council is supportive
of and encouraged by the recent
decision of the Ohio Supreme Court
that declared a minority set-aside
program for state construction contracts constitutional; and
Whereas, the Council urges Governor Taft to reactivate the minority set-aside program for state construction contracts that had been
discontinued in November, 1998 as
soon as possible; and

April 21, 1999
Whereas, the Council is strongly
opposed to the legislation introduced in the state legislature by
Senator Eugene Watts that would
replace Ohio’s current set-aside program with a “Challenged Business
Enterprise Program”; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland recognizes the
necessity for strong Minority and
Female Business Enterprise programs and urges Governor Taft to
reinstitute the state minority setaside program as soon as possible.
Section 2. That the Council strongly urges state legislators to oppose
the recent legislation introduced by
State Senator Eugene Watts that
would discontinue MBE programs.
Section 3. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to the following: Governor Robert Taft; Ohio Speaker of
the House JoAnn Davidson; President of the Ohio Senate Richard
Finan; and State Senator Eugene
Watts.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

Res. No. 608-99.
By Councilmen Willis and Westbrook.
An emergency resolution supporting a lawsuit filed by the City of
Cleveland to require firearms manufacturers to act safely and responsibly and opposing attempts to pass
legislation at the state level to bar
the filing of such lawsuits.
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland, through Resolution No.
2125-98 adopted December 7, 1998,
acknowledged
the
danger
of
firearms and urged the Mayor and
Director of Law to institute a lawsuit against firearm manufacturers
on the basis of public nuisance and
product liability; and
Whereas, the Mayor recently filed
an action in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court against firearms
manufacturers for failing to act
safely and responsibly; and
Whereas,
in
response
to
the
actions of this Council and the
Administration, the National Rifle
Association (NRA) announced its
intent to seek a sponsor for legislation at the state level to bar lawsuits against firearm manufacturers;
and
Whereas, the NRA has lobbied for
similar legislation to limit lawsuits
in Alabama, Louisiana and Wyoming;
and
Whereas, this Council believes
that firearm manufacturers must be
held to the same, if not heighted,
standards as other manufacturers of
dangerous products, and is therefore
opposed to any attempts to limit
lawsuits against firearm manufacturers; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland is supportive of
attempts to hold firearm manufacturers accountable to act safely and
responsibly in the manufacturing

The City Record
and marketing of its products.
Section 2. That this Council opposes the intent of the National Rifle
Association to seek a legislative
prohibition at the state level to filing lawsuits against firearm manufacturers and strongly urges state
legislators to reject such attempts
by the NRA.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is requested to transmit a copy
of this Resolution to Speaker of the
House JoAnn Davidson; Ohio Senate
President Richard Finan; and Mayor
Michael White.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

Ord. No. 1143-98.
By Mayor White.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Mayor to enter into an
agreement with The City of Cleveland and Omni Outdoor & Company
Limited Partnership, or its designee,
to develop a system of informational kiosks to assist both tourists and
local residents visiting cultural and
other
attractions
in
Cleveland’s
neighborhoods and downtown, designating the programs for royalties
received from that kiosk system,
granting encroachment permits and
outlining other aspects of the kiosk
system.
Whereas, the number of cultural
and
other
attractions
to
both
tourists and local residents has
increased in Cleveland’s neighborhoods and downtown over the past
decade, causing an increase in
pedestrian and other traffic in these
areas;
Whereas, directional and pathfinding maps would be beneficial to
these pedestrians and other travellers;
Whereas, City officials have been
working with a company to develop
a system of informational kiosks for
Cleveland;
Whereas, the system of informational
kiosks
to
be
developed
through this legislation is intended
to improve the quality of life and
further the public convenience;
Whereas, this Council finds that it
is necessary to impose restrictions,
based on health, safety and welfare
considerations, on the use of the
informational kiosks for certain purposes that are inconsistent with the
positive goals intended by the creation of this forum;
Whereas, the system of informational
kiosks
to
be
developed
through this legislation is declared
by this Council to be a limited public forum;
Whereas, the creation of a limited
public forum is intended to preserve
the positive goals intended by the
introduction of kiosks into the community;
Whereas, this Council finds that
the public policy that was established by the passage last year of
Chapters 680A and 680B of the Codified
Ordinances,
which
imposed
time, place and scope limitations on
the placement of advertisements for
alcohol and tobacco products, should
be continued and furthered by the

669

31
establishment of restrictions on the
placement of such advertisements
on the informational kiosks;
Whereas, these additional restrictions are being imposed for the
same public policy reasons that led
to the passage of Chapters 680A and
680B;
Whereas,
this
Council
further
finds that the public policy established by Sections 350.11 and 623.14
of the Codified Ordinances, which
prohibits, among other things, the
posting of political signs upon any
public property, should be continued
and furthered by prohibiting the
placement
of
political
advertisements on the informational kiosks;
Whereas, in addition to continuation of the existing public policy
established by Sections 350.11 and
623.14,
political
advertisements
would detract aesthetically from the
informational
kiosks,
especially
because this type of advertisement
tends to remain posted after the
election or event for which the political advertisement was placed;
Whereas, limiting kiosk advertising to innocuous and less controversial commercial and service-oriented advertising minimizes the
chances of abuse, appearances of
political favoritism, public dissension and complaints and the risk of
imposing upon an unwilling audience;
Whereas, this Council finds that
there are many other forums for the
exercise of political speech, and for
the placement of political ads, and
many other forums for the advertisement of alcohol and tobacco
products;
Whereas, this Council finds that
the restrictions being imposed by
this legislation on the placement of
advertisements on kiosks for alcohol
and tobacco products and political
advertisements are narrow, reasonable, and necessary to the goals
intended by the creation of this limited public forum;
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That notwithstanding
any other ordinance or Codified
Ordinance to the contrary, and in
accordance
with
the
Whereas
clauses found in the preamble of
this ordinance, which are hereby
declared to be legislative findings
of this Council, the Mayor is hereby
authorized to enter into an Agreement with Omni Outdoor & Company
Limited
Partnership,
or
its
designee, for the design, construction, installation and maintenance
of a network of kiosks providing
directional and other information to
be located throughout the City.
Section 2. That notwithstanding
any other ordinance or Codified
Ordinance
to
the
contrary,
the
Agreement authorized by Section 1
of this ordinance shall be substantially in the form as follows:

18.1 Company acknowledges that

minority
persons
and
females shall have every practicable opportunity to participate in the
performance of contracts awarded
or assisted by the City. Company
shall use its best efforts to award
fifteen percent (15%) of the construction contracts and supplier purchase orders for the Network to
minority owned business enterprises and five percent (5%) of the construction contracts and supplier purchase orders for the Network to
female owned business enterprises
(“MBE/FBE”), as those phrases are
defined in Section 187.01 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland, that have been certified by the
City’s Office of Equal Opportunity
(“MBE/FBE Participation Requirements”). Exemptions may be granted by the City on contracts for purchase and installation of specialized
equipment or materials installed by
the manufacturer. Company shall
make a good faith effort to obtain
any exemption from the City prior
to the execution of the contract for
the purchase and installation of
such specialized equipment or materials, but in no event shall an
exemption be obtained later than
the commencement of construction
of
the
Network
component
for
which
the
exemption
is
being
sought.
The MBE/FBE Participation Requirement shall be equal to the total
dollar amount of construction contracts, and supplier purchase orders
less approved exemptions multiplied
by fifteen percent (15%) and five
percent (5%), respectively. To verify the award of MBE/FBE contracts, Company shall submit to the
City copies of all contracts, subcontracts, purchase orders, lien waivers
or other evidence of payment acceptable to the City.

672

April 21, 1999
Materials and supplies obtained
from MBE/FBE suppliers and manufacturers may be counted towards
fulfilling the MBE/FBE Participation Requirements if the MBE/FBE
assumes the actual and contractual
responsibility for the provision of
the materials and supplies. The total
dollar value will be counted in the
case of MBE/FBE manufacturers
and suppliers, provided that the
MBE/FBE supplier performs a commercially useful function in the supply process. An MBE/FBE firm who
performs
a
commercially
useful
function is one who supervises, manages or actually performs a distinct
element of the work.
18.2 This Agreement is a “contract”, and Company is a “contractor” within the meaning of Chapter
187 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland. During the term of this

terms,
conditions
and
requirements imposed on a “contractor” in the Equal Opportunity
Clause, Section 187.11(b), attached
as Exhibit B and made a part hereof. A copy of the Equal Opportunity Clause shall be made a part of
every
subcontract
or
agreement
entered into for goods or services,
and shall be binding on all persons,
firms and corporations with whom
Company may deal.
