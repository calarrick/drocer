FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL

Res. No. 1045-99.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Congress to amend H.R. 10,
the Financial Services Modernization Act, to benefit lower income
urban areas.
Whereas, since the passage of the
Community
Reinvestment
Act
(CRA) in 1977, FDIC-insured banks
have loaned more than $1.4 billion
in underserved communities; and
Whereas, CRA lending has assisted in the revitalization of the City
of Cleveland and has proven to be
an important economic development
tool to increase home ownership and
economic development in low-income
urban communities; and
Whereas, the Financial Services
Modernization Act, H.R. 10, should
include modernization of the CRA to
include
lending
and
traditional
banking services whether performed
by a bank or one of the new affiliates of the bank holding companies
which may be formed with the passage of H.R. 10; and
Whereas, if the CRA is not
amended
to
include
traditional
lending and banking services performed in the past only by banks,

1096

June 9, 1999
the new affiliates of bank holding
companies could fail to provide services to lower income communities
which could adversely affect the
residents of Cleveland; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the members of the House Commerce Committee and the United States House
of Representatives to amend H.R.
10, the Financial Services Modernization Act, to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act which
would benefit lower income urban
areas and spur increased economic
development.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to Speaker of the
House Hastert and Congress members
Kucinich,
Tubbs-Jones,
LaTourette, Brown and Sawyer.
Section 3. That this resolution is

An emergency resolution supporting stricter federal regulations
for the sale and marketing of
firearms.
Whereas, through the passage of
numerous resolutions, this Council
of the City of Cleveland has voiced
its concern about the proliferation
of firearms and the horrific harm
that guns can inflict; and
Whereas, current federal law permits any individual, regardless of
age, to purchase any rifle, shotgun
or other long gun in a private sale
and permits individuals over the age
of 18 and under the age of 21 to purchase a handgun, including an
assault pistol, in a private transaction; and
Whereas, many firearms are now
sold privately at, or in association
with, organized “gun shows”; and
Whereas, current federal law does
not require the purchaser or transferee of a firearm acquired in a private gun show sale to undergo a
background check of any kind; and
Whereas,
no
federal
agency
presently has jurisdiction to regulate or otherwise oversee the design,
safety and responsible marketing of
firearms; and
Whereas, the United States Senate
has approved a measure exempting
pawn shops from conducting background
checks
upon
individuals
redeeming firearms that were previously pawned; and
Whereas, the Internet has the
potential to function as a wholly
unregulated “virtual gun show” and
presently features many sites devoted to commerce of firearms; now,
therefore,

June 9, 1999
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland urges Congress
and the Administration to seek legislation at the federal level that
would help ensure the safety of our
citizens by:
1. prohibiting the purchase or possession of a rifle or assault weapon
by a juvenile; and
2.
prohibiting
an
individual
between the ages of 18 and 21 from
purchasing a handgun; and
3. requiring that all purchasers of
firearms in a private sale, including
organized “gun shows,” be subject to
the same background investigation
as individuals who purchase firearms
from
federal
firearms
licensees; and
4. vesting authority in the Consumer Product Safety Commission to
regulate and otherwise oversee the
design, safety and responsible marketing of firearms; and
5. assuring that Internet-facilitated firearms commerce is subject to
the same regulation and oversight
as all other commerce in firearms.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
strongly opposes any statutory or
regulatory measure that would subject an individual who redeems a
weapon from a pawnshop to a less
scrutinized background check than
the background of an individual
who purchased a firearm from a federal firearms licensee.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is requested to transmit a copy
of this Resolution to President Clinton; Vice-President Gore; Attorney
General Reno; Speaker of the House
Hastert; Senator DeWine; Senator
Voinovich; Congressmen Kucinich,
Brown, Sawyer and LaTourette; and
Congresswoman Tubbs-Jones.
