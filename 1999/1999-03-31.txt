By Councilman Johnson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the City of Cleveland to
implement a plan to allow certain
City employees to purchase additional service credit from the Police
and Fire Disability and Pension
Fund, tax-deferred by payroll deduction.
Whereas, Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Code Section 414(h)(2)
permits employer “pick-up” of the
employee contributions to a retirement plan, thereby resulting in
tax deferral of such contributions;
and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Revised
Code Chapter 742 and Police and
Fire Disability and Pension Fund
(“PFDPF”) plan conditions, members may be allowed to (1) redeposit
contributions previously withdrawn,
plus interest, and/or (2) purchase
additional forms of permissive service credit; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has no current plan authorizing the
purchase of additional service credit from PFDPF on a pre-tax basis;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That effective April 1,
1999, members of the PFDPF who
are eligible under IRS Code Section
414(h)(2) and Revised Code Chapter 742 may purchase additional
service credit tax deferred and the
City shall withhold the authorized
service credit deduction from the
gross pay of each person who
elects to purchase additional ser-

vice credit and pay the deduction
from the PFDPF. A person electing
this pick up deduction shall not
have the option of choosing to
receive
the
payroll
deduction
directly instead of having this
deduction picked up by the City
and paid to the PFDPF.
Members who have elected to participate in this plan cannot increase,
decrease or terminate the amount of
the pick up deduction.
Section 2. That the Director of
Finance is hereby authorized to
take all necessary procedural and
administrative action to implement
the provisions of this ordinance to
effect the pick up of the payroll
deduction for the purchase of additional service credit to the PFDPF,
including entering into irrevocable
salary reduction agreements with
eligible employees. The form of
such agreement shall contain such
terms and conditions as are acceptable to the Director of Law.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

its final passage at the next meeting:
ORDINANCE
Ord. No. 1143-98.
By Mayor White.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Mayor to enter into an
agreement with The City of Cleveland and Omni Outdoor & Company
Limited Partnership, or its designee,
to develop a system of informational kiosks to assist both tourists and
local residents visiting cultural and
other
attractions
in
Cleveland’s
neighborhoods and downtown, designating the programs for royalties
received from that kiosk system,
granting encroachment permits and
outlining other aspects of the kiosk
system.
Whereas, the number of cultural
and
other
attractions
to
both
tourists and local residents has
increased in Cleveland’s neighborhoods and downtown over the past
decade, causing an increase in
pedestrian and other traffic in these
areas;
Whereas, directional and pathfinding maps would be beneficial to
these pedestrians and other travellers;
Whereas, City officials have been
working with a company to develop
a system of informational kiosks for
Cleveland;
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That notwithstanding
any other ordinance or Codified
Ordinance
to
the
contrary,
the
Mayor is hereby authorized to enter
into an Agreement with Omni Outdoor & Company Limited Partnership, or its designee, for the design,
construction, installation and maintenance of a network of kiosks providing directional and other information to be located throughout the
City.
Section 2. That notwithstanding
any other ordinance or Codified
Ordinance
to
the
contrary,
the
Agreement authorized by Section 1
of this ordinance shall be substantially in the form as follows:
AGREEMENT BY AND BETWEEN
THE CITY OF CLEVELAND
AND
OMNI OUTDOOR & COMPANY
LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
THIS AGREEMENT (“Agreement”)
is made this _____ day of _______,
1998, by and between THE CITY OF

thousand dollars ($700,000) of fixed
costs.
12.3 The above royalties in section
12.2 are conditional upon having 195
kiosks, or a lesser mutually agreed

18.1 Company acknowledges that
it is the policy of the City that business concerns owned and operated
by minority persons and females
shall have every practicable opportunity to participate in the performance of contracts awarded or
assisted by the City. Company shall
use its best efforts to award fifteen
percent (15%) of the construction
contracts
and
supplier
purchase
orders for the Network to minority
owned business enterprises and five
percent (5%) of the construction
contracts
and
supplier
purchase
orders for the Network to female
owned
business
enterprises
(“MBE/FBE”), as those phrases are
defined in Section 187.01 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland, that have been certified by the
City’s Office of Equal Opportunity
(“MBE/FBE Participation Requirements”). Exemptions may be granted by the City on contracts for purchase and installation of specialized
equipment or materials installed by
the manufacturer. Company shall
make a good faith effort to obtain
any exemption from the City prior
to the execution of the contract for
the purchase and installation of
such specialized equipment or materials, but in no event shall an
exemption be obtained later than
the commencement of construction
of
the
Network
component
for
which
the
exemption
is
being
sought.
The MBE/FBE Participation Requirement shall be equal to the total
dollar amount of construction contracts, and supplier purchase orders
less approved exemptions multiplied
by fifteen percent (15%) and five
percent (5%), respectively. To verify the award of MBE/FBE contracts, Company shall submit to the
City copies of all contracts, subcontracts, purchase orders, lien waivers
or other evidence of payment acceptable to the City.
Materials and supplies obtained
from MBE/FBE suppliers and man-

ufacturers may be counted towards
fulfilling the MBE/FBE Participation Requirements if the MBE/FBE
assumes the actual and contractual
responsibility for the provision of
the materials and supplies. The total
dollar value will be counted in the
case of MBE/FBE manufacturers
and suppliers, provided that the
MBE/FBE supplier performs a commercially useful function in the supply process. An MBE/FBE firm who
performs
a
commercially
useful
function is one who supervises, manages or actually performs a distinct
element of the work.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 340-99.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
HUD to demolish the Belvoir-Cliffs
apartment building and to grant
title to the property to the City of
Cleveland for compatible neighborhood development.
Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
(HUD) owns the Belvoir-Cliffs, a 160
unit apartment building, located at the
intersection of Belvoir Blvd. and Cliffview Road in the Euclid Park community of the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, HUD was forced to
assume ownership and control of the
building because its previous owner
let the property fall into severe disrepair, as evidenced by numerous
significant code violations and its
very low occupancy rate; and
Whereas, Belvoir-Cliffs has become a haven for illegal drug activities and prostitution, presenting a
profound safety risk to the surrounding neighborhood; and
Whereas, the configuration of the
buildings lacks recreational and
structural amenities and presents a
barracks-like appearance, detracting
from the aesthetic appearance of the
neighborhood
and
making
it
markedly different from the surrounding ranch-style houses; and
Whereas, the citizens of the community, in the interest of safety and
well-being
of
the
neighborhood,
have expressed their desire to have
the facility demolished, as opposed
to HUD performing a cosmetic alteration of the apartment building;
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges HUD to act
in the best interest of the residents
of the City of Cleveland and to
demolish the Belvoir-Cliffs apartment building, as it unsafe and
undesirable for low income housing.
Section 2. That, upon demolition of
Belvoir-Cliffs, HUD grant title to the
property to the City of Cleveland so
that it may be developed in a use
that is compatible with and meets the
needs of the surrounding community.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this Resolution to Andrew
Cuomo, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; Mayor Michael White; and
Linda Hudecek, Director of Community Development.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 1, 1999.
Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.
Res. No. 464-99.
By Councilman Cimperman.

the transfer of ownership and loca-

tion of a D5 Liquor Permit to 1300
W. Ninth St., by Res. No. 41-99
adopted by this Council on January
11, 1999; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
transfer of ownership and location
and consents to said transfer of
ownership and location; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to the
transfer of ownership and location
of a D5 Liquor Permit to 1300 W.
Ninth St., be and the same is hereby withdrawn and Res. No. 41-99,
containing said objection, be and
the same is hereby repealed and
that this Council consents to the
immediate transfer of ownership
and location thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

shall take effect and be in force

Res. No. 465-99.
By Councilman Cintron.

Res. No. 466-99.
By Councilman Willis.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to adopt
more stringent laws relative to seat
belts and to encourage law enforcement agencies to strictly enforce
seat belt usage.
Whereas, in 1997, 1,015 children
between the ages of 4 and 15 were
killed in automobile crashes while
riding unrestrained by a seat belt;
and
Whereas, a panel of safety experts convened by U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater recommended that seat belt laws become
more stringent and that greater
attention is given to enforcement;
and
Whereas, children are a precious
resource that should be treasured
and protected by the fullest extent
of the law; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland urges the Governor and
State General Assembly to safeguard the interest of all children in
the State of Ohio by adopting legislation to strengthen existing seat
belt laws; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Governor and State General Assembly to

City of Cleveland urges the Governor
and State General Assembly to adopt

determined that the seat belts were
purposely misused or damaged.

enforcement
agencies
throughout
the State of Ohio, including Cleveland police officers, to give heightened scrutiny to seat belt enforcement and use, particularly with
respect to children.

copy of this Resolution to U.S.
Transportation
Secretary
Rodney
Slater,
Governor
Taft,
Speaker
JoAnn Davidson, Ohio Senate President Richard Finan, Attorney General Betty Montgomery, Ohio Director of Public Safety Maureen O’Connor and Cleveland Director of Public Safety Henry Guzman.

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
