When any person is found guilty of

of the posted speed limit by ten
miles an hour or more, such person
is guilty of a misdemeanor of the

found guilty of a violation of Section 433.07(b)(8), in addition to all
other penalties provided by law,
such person shall be fined two times

(2) Driving under the influence.
Whoever violates division (a) of
Section 433.01, in addition to the

shall
be
punished
as
provided in division A., B. or C.
below:
A. If, within six years of the
offense, the offender has not been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to
any violation of division (a) or (b)
of Section 433.01, RC 4511.19, a
municipal
ordinance
relating
to
operating a vehicle while under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of
abuse, a municipal ordinance relating to operating a vehicle with a
prohibited concentration of alcohol
in the blood, breath, or urine, RC
2903.04 in a case in which the
offender was subject to the sanctions described in Division (D) of
that section, or RC 2903.06, 2903.07,
or 2903.08 or a municipal ordinance
that is substantially similar to RC
2903.07 in a case in which the jury
or judge found that the offender
was under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a
drug of abuse, the offender is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the first degree
and the court shall sentence the

on
probation
and
requires the offender to attend, for
three consecutive days, a drivers’
intervention program that is certified pursuant to RC 3793.10. The
court also may suspend the execution of any part of the mandatory
three consecutive days of imprisonment that it is required to impose

the offender on probation for part of
the three consecutive days; requires

The City Record
the offender to attend, for that part
of the three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention program that is
certified pursuant to RC 3793.10; and
sentences the offender to a term of
imprisonment equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days
that the offender does not spend
attending the drivers’ intervention
program. The court may require the
offender, as a condition of probation, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education
programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
RC Chapter 3793, by the Director of
Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services, in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers’ intervention
program, that the operators of the
drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender should attend
and to report periodically to the
court on his progress in the programs. The court also may impose
any other conditions of probation on
the offender that it considers necessary.
B. If, within six years of the
offense, the offender has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
violation of division (a) or (b) of
Section 433.01, RC 4511.19, a municipal ordinance relating to operating
a vehicle while under the influence
of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, a municipal ordinance relating to operating
a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in the blood,
breath, or urine, RC 2903.04 in a case
in which the offender was subject
to the sanctions described in Division (D) of that section, or RC
2903.06, 2903.07, or 2903.08 or a
municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to RC 2903.07 in a
case in which the jury or judge
found that the offender was under
the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of
abuse, the offender is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree and
the court shall sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment of ten
consecutive days and may sentence

(b) of Section 403.99 to a longer
term of imprisonment. In addition,
the court shall impose upon the

hundred dollars ($1,500).
In addition to any other sentence
that it imposes upon the offender,
the court may require the offender
to attend a drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to
RC 3793.10. If the officials of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender is alcohol
dependent, they shall notify the
court, and the court shall order the
offender
to
obtain
treatment
through an alcohol and drug addiction program authorized by RC
3793.02. The cost of the treatment
shall be paid by the offender.
C. If, within six years of the
offense, the offender has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two
violations of division (a) or (b) of
Section 433.01, RC 4511.19, a municipal ordinance relating to operating
a vehicle while under the influence
of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, a municipal ordinance relating to operating
a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in the blood,
breath or urine, RC 2903.04 in a case
in which the offender was subject
to the sanctions described in Division (D) of that section, or RC

2342

December 22, 1999
2903.06, 2903.07, 2903.08 or a municipal ordinance that is substantially
similar to RC 2903.07 in a case in
which the jury or judge found that
the offender was under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or
alcohol and a drug of abuse, the
court shall sentence the offender to
a term of imprisonment of thirty
consecutive days and may sentence
the offender to a longer definite
term of imprisonment of not more
than one year. In addition, the court
shall impose upon the offender a
fine of not less than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) and not more than
two thousand five hundred dollars
($2,500).
In addition to any other sentence
that it imposes upon the offender,
the court shall require the offender
to attend an alcohol and drug addiction program authorized by RC
3793.02. The cost of the treatment
shall be paid by the offender. If the
court determines that the offender is
unable to pay the cost of his attendance at the treatment program, the
court may order that the payment of
the cost of the offender’s attendance
at the treatment program be made
from the court’s indigent drivers
alcohol treatment fund, created pursuant to division (N) of RC 4511.191.
D. Twenty-five dollars ($25.00) of
each fine imposed pursuant to divisions (a)(2)A., B. or C. of this Section shall be deposited into the indigent drivers alcohol treatment fund
of the court, created pursuant to
division (N) of RC 4511.191.
E. Upon a showing that imprisonment would seriously affect the ability of an offender sentenced pursuant to divisions (a)(2)A. to C. of
this section to continue his employment, the court may authorize that
the
offender
be
granted
work
release from imprisonment after the
offender has served the three, ten,
thirty, or sixty consecutive days of
imprisonment
that
the
court
is
required by divisions (a)(2)A. to C.
of this Section to impose. No court
shall authorize work release from
imprisonment during the three, ten,
thirty, or sixty consecutive days of
imprisonment
that
the
court
is
required by divisions (a)(2)A. to C.
of this section to impose. The duration of the work release shall not
exceed the time necessary each day
for the offender to commute to and
from the place of employment and
the place of imprisonment and the
time actually spent under employment.
F. Notwithstanding any section of
the Revised Code or this Traffic
Code that authorizes suspension of
the imposition or execution of a sentence or the placement of an offender in any treatment program in lieu
of imprisonment, no court shall suspend the ten, thirty, or sixty consecutive
days
of
imprisonment
required to be imposed by divisions
(a)(2)B. to C. of this section or
place an offender who is sentenced
pursuant to division (a)(2)B. to C.

after the offender has served the
ten, thirty, or sixty consecutive days
of imprisonment required to be

pursuant
to
division
(a)(2)B. to C. of this section.
Notwithstanding any section of

in lieu of imprisonment, no court,
except as specifically authorized by

division (a)(2)A. of this section,
shall suspend the three consecutive
days of imprisonment required to be
imposed by division (a)(2)A. of this
section or place an offender who is

served the three consecutive days of
imprisonment
required

pursuant
to
division
(a)(2)A. of this section.
