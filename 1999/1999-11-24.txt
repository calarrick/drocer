RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL

Res. No. 2071-99.
By Councilman Cintron.
An emergency resolution supporting the rapid passage of H.R. 289/S.
1591 to restore control of Vieques to
the Government of Puerto Rico and
urging President Clinton to immediately cease using the island as a
bombing and firing range for military exercises.
Whereas,
Vieques
is
a
small
island on the eastern end of Puerto
Rico, with a land area of approximately 33,000 acres, and is home to
9,300 U.S. Citizens; and
Whereas, the United States Navy,
through eminent domain, assumed
control of more than three-quarters
of the Vieques in 1941 for naval
maneuvers. The Navy uses the eastern end of Vieques as a bombing
range, both from ships and the air,
and
as
an
amphibious
landing
maneuver; the western side is used
for the maintenance of an ammunition dump and radar equipment. The
Viequenses live in the middle of the
island, between the naval operations; and
Whereas, the people of Vieques
are forced to live in war-like conditions on a daily basis; and
Whereas, on April 19, 1999, during
a Navy air training mission, two 500
pound bombs were dropped on a
guard station, resulting in the death
of a civilian security guard and the
injury of four other persons; and
Whereas, the Vieques’ population
is plagued with other problems
believed to be the result of U.S.
naval presence and the use and testing of chemical weapons such as
napalm and depleted uranium; such
problems include: a cancer rate 27%
higher than that in Puerto Rico; an
excessively high poverty rate of
73%; and an infant mortality rate
among the highest of any municipality in Puerto Rico; and
Whereas, there is bipartisan legislation pending before Congress,
H.R. 2890/S. 1591, that seeks to
restore control of Vieques to the
Government of Puerto Rico; and
Whereas, this resolution constititutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety in
that the people of Vieques are suffering daily from the presence of
the United States Navy, now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland supports the rapid
passage of H.R. 289/S. 1591 to
restore control of Vieques to the
Government of Puerto Rico and

area Representatives to the U.S.
House of Representatives; and Senators Voinovich and DeWine.

An emergency resolution urging
Cleveland’s congressional delegation
to devote their attention, power and
compassion to assist the people of
El Salvador.
Whereas, El Salvador is a small
country located in Central America,
but has borne an inordinate amount
of strife for such a small nation; and
Whereas, during the last three
decades of this century, the people
of El Salvador have been subjected
to great turmoil and civil war, with
the slaying of nearly 75,000 people;
the unaccounted for disappearance
of untold numbers of people, and the
displacement of almost one-third of
the population; and
Whereas, three especially heinous
events have received world-wide
media attention: the assassination of
Archbishop Romero in March, 1980;
the killing of four North American
missionary women, two of whom
were
natives
of
Cleveland,
in
December, 1980; and the massacre of
six Jesuit priests and two women coworkers in November, 1989; and
Whereas, the Jesuit Order has
been in El Salvador providing education and faith service to thousands
of people through the University of
Central America, with their presence
well known to the government, military, and most notably to the poor
for whom they have provided preferential concern; and in return for
their kind and humanitarian efforts,
members of the Order are subject to
great physical risk; and
Whereas,
the
United
States
government, as a powerful, wealthy
and just country, should support
grass roots economic development in
El Salvador and should urge the
IMF/World Bank to forgive El Salvador’s debt; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Cleveland area representatives to the United States House of Representatives
and Senators Voinovich and DeWine
to devote their attention, power and
compassion to assist the people of El
Salvador in their grass roots economic development efforts; to permanently close and eliminate funding for the School of the Americas;
and to urge the IMF/World Bank to
forgive the debt of El Salvador.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 15, 1999.
Effective November 22, 1999, without the signature of the Mayor.
