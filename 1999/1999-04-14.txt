firearms and urged the Mayor and
Director of Law to institute a lawsuit against firearm manufacturers
on the basis of public nuisance and
product liability; and
Whereas, the Mayor recently filed
an action in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court against firearms
manufacturers for failing to act
safely and responsibly; and
Whereas,
in
response
to
the
actions of this Council and the
Administration, the National Rifle
Association (NRA) announced its
intent to seek a sponsor for legislation at the state level to bar lawsuits against firearm manufacturers;
and
Whereas, the NRA has lobbied for
similar legislation to limit lawsuits
in Alabama, Louisiana and Wyoming;
and
Whereas, this Council believes
that firearm manufacturers must be
held to the same, if not heighted,
standards as other manufacturers of
dangerous products, and is therefore
opposed to any attempts to limit
lawsuits against firearm manufacturers; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland is supportive of
attempts to hold firearm manufacturers accountable to act safely and
responsibly in the manufacturing
and marketing of its products.
Section 2. That this Council opposes the intent of the National Rifle
Association to seek a legislative
prohibition at the state level to filing lawsuits against firearm manufacturers and strongly urges state
legislators to reject such attempts
by the NRA.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is requested to transmit a copy
of this Resolution to Speaker of the
House JoAnn Davidson; Ohio Senate
President Richard Finan; and Mayor
Michael White.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

“Whereas, the system of informational
kiosks
to
be
developed
through this legislation is intended
to improve the quality of life and
further the public convenience;
Whereas, this Council finds that it
is necessary to impose restrictions,
based on health, safety and welfare
considerations, on the use of the
informational kiosks for certain
purposes that are inconsistent with
the positive goals intended by the
creation of this forum.
Whereas, the system of informational
kiosks
to
be
developed
through this legislation is declared
by this Council to be a limited public forum;
Whereas, the creation of a limited
public forum is intended to preserve
the positive goals intended by the
introduction of kiosks into the community;
Whereas, this Council finds that
the public policy that was established by the passage last year of
Chapters 680A and 680B of the Codified
Ordinances,
which
imposed
time, place and scope limitations on
the placement of advertisements for
alcohol and tobacco products, should
be continued and furthered by the
establishment of restrictions on the
placement of such advertisements
on the informational kiosks;
Whereas, these additional restrictions are being imposed for the
same public policy reasons that led
to the passage of Chapters 680A and
680B;
Whereas,
this
Council
further
finds that the public policy established by Sections 350.11 and 623.14
of the Codified Ordinances, which
prohibits, among other things, the
posting of political signs upon any
public property, should be continued
and furthered by prohibiting the
placement
of
political
advertisements on the informational kiosks;
Whereas, in addition to continuation of the existing public policy
established by Sections 350.11 and
623.14,
political
advertisements
would detract aesthetically from the
informational
kiosks,
especially
because this type of advertisement
tends to remain posted after the
election or event for which the political advertisement was placed;
Whereas, limiting kiosk advertising to innocuous and less controversial commercial and service-oriented advertising minimizes the
chances of abuse, appearances of
political favoritism, public dissension and complaints and the risk of
imposing upon an unwilling audience;
Whereas, this Council finds that
there are many other forums for the
exercise of political speech, and for
the placement of political ads, and
many other forums for the advertisement of alcohol and tobacco
products;
Whereas, this Council finds that
the restrictions being imposed by
this legislation on the placement of
advertisements on kiosks for alcohol

614

April 14, 1999
and tobacco products and political
advertisements are narrow, reasonable, and necessary to the goals
intended by the creation of this limited public forum;”.
26. In Section 1, in line 2, after the
phrase “to the contrary,” insert “and
in accordance with the Whereas
clauses found in the preamble of
this ordinance, which are hereby
declared to be legislative findings
of this Council,”.
27. In Section 2, at Agreement Section 11., insert a new subsection at
the end to read as follows (this
amendment supersedes any previous
amendment adding a new subsection
to Section 11. recommended by any
Council committee):
“11.2 No elected official’s name,
picture or likeness shall appear on
the kiosk structure or the face designated for tourist orientation or
public information or on any other
face, except as part of a paid advertisement, provided that the paid
advertisement is not a political
advertisement prohibited in Section
15.2.”
28. In Section 2, at Agreement Section 15., at the end of Section 15.2,
insert the following new paragraph:
“The Company acknowledges and
agrees that it shall not post or allow
to be posted on the Network any
advertising for a ballot issue, a candidate for office, a partisan political
activity or a position on a political
issue.”
29. Insert new Section 5 to read as
follows (this amendment supersedes
any previous amendment inserting a
new Section 5 recommended by any
Council committee):
“Section 5. That no elected official’s name, picture or likeness shall
appear on the maps or tourist information signs or any other signs,
except as part of a paid advertisement, provided that the paid advertisement is not advertising a ballot
issue, a candidate for office, a partisan political activity or a position
on a political issue.”

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1271-98.
By Councilman Jackson (by request).
An emergency resolution declaring the intention to vacate all that
portion of East 53rd Street.
Whereas, this Council; is satisfied
that there is good cause to vacate
all that portion of East 53rd Street,
as hereinafter described, and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure in that
the same provides for the usual
daily
operation
of
a
municipal
department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it hereby declares
its intention to vacate all those portions of the following described real
property:
Being all that portion of EAST
53RD STREET, (50.00 feet wide)
extending
Southerly
from
the
Southerly line of Woodland Avenue
S.E. (99.00 feet wide) to that portion
of East 53rd Street vacated by the
Council of the City of Cleveland by

Ordinance Number 897-68, passed
May 27, 1968.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 29, 1999.
Effective April 7, 1999.
Res. No. 340-99.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
HUD to demolish the Belvoir-Cliffs
apartment building and to grant
title to the property to the City of
Cleveland for compatible neighborhood development.
Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) owns the Belvoir-Cliffs, a 160
unit apartment building, located at
the intersection of Belvoir Blvd. and
Cliffview Road in the Euclid Park

630

community of the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, HUD was forced to
assume ownership and control of
the building because its previous
owner let the property fall into
severe disrepair, as evidenced by
numerous significant code violations and its very low occupancy
rate; and
Whereas, Belvoir-Cliffs has become a haven for illegal drug activities and prostitution, presenting a
profound safety risk to the surrounding neighborhood; and
Whereas, the configuration of
the buildings lacks recreational
and structural amenities and presents a barracks-like appearance,
detracting
from
the
aesthetic
appearance of the neighborhood
and making it markedly different
from the surrounding ranch-style
houses; and
Whereas, the citizens of the community, in the interest of safety and
well-being
of
the
neighborhood,
have expressed their desire to have
the facility demolished, as opposed
to HUD performing a cosmetic alteration of the apartment building;
now, therefore,

The City Record

April 14, 1999
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges HUD to act
in the best interest of the residents
of the City of Cleveland and to
demolish the Belvoir-Cliffs apartment building, as it unsafe and
undesirable for low income housing.
Section 2. That, upon demolition of
Belvoir-Cliffs, HUD grant title to the
property to the City of Cleveland so
that it may be developed in a use
that is compatible with and meets
the needs of the surrounding community.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this Resolution to Andrew
Cuomo, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; Mayor Michael White; and
Linda Hudecek, Director of Community Development.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 1, 1999.
Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.
