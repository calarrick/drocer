2. That in the event there is a

The City Record

the TIF.
3. Failure by Redeveloper or the
operator(s) of the project to substantially comply with the following

throughout the duration of the TIF;
c. Compliance with Section 9 of
this ordinance; and
d. Renovation of the public open
space of the arcade and maintaining
same as open space for the public
use.
Section 9. 1. With respect to the
relationship with and activities of
any operator to the hotel located on
the Property, it is agreed that such
hotel operator shall recognize and
observe the right of its employees to
form or select any labor organization to act as the employees’ exclusive bargaining representative for
the purpose of collective bargaining
with the operator, or to refrain from
such activity, and the right of a
labor organization to organize the
employees.
2. With respect to the relationship
with and activities of the hotel operator, the Redeveloper agrees as a
condition of its financial assistance
from the City, in addition to the
foregoing, that the provisions set
forth in the section shall apply.
a. To accommodate a free and
informed decision of the employees
of the hotel respecting joining or
seeking representation by a labor
organization, the hotel operator will
provide access to certain non-work
areas within the hotel during certain non-work times, the exact locations and times to be mutually
agreed upon by both the union and
the hotel operator.
b. The hotel operator shall have
the right to communicate with its
employees during the organizing
process, shall insure that such communications are factual, and shall
neither show nor disseminate antiunion material in its communications with its employees.
c. Upon notice from the union that
at least 30% of employees in an
appropriate bargaining unit have
signed authorization cards, the hotel
operator and labor organization will
take all actions necessary to effect
validation of such cards within thirty (30) days by the National Labor
Relations Board (“NLRB”). If cards
signed by a majority of bargaining
unit employees are validated by the
NLRB, the employees will vote on
the question of representation by
the labor organization within sixty
(60) days from date of the NLRB
meeting to validate the cards. If a
majority of bargaining unit employees that vote, vote in favor of representation by a labor organization
the hotel operator will recognize
such labor organization as bargaining representative.
d. If one or more labor organizations notifies the hotel operator that
a majority of employees in a proposed bargaining unit or units have
signed authorization cards, the hotel
operator
will
make
good
faith
efforts to reach agreement and stipulate to the definition of a bargain-

1022

June 2, 1999
ing unit. The hotel operator will not
assert questions about the definition
of the bargaining unit as a means
of delaying or impeding the rights
of employees and labor organization(s) to proceed expeditiously to
an election under the NLRB supervision.
e. The hotel operator shall further
agree that interest demonstrated by
employees of the hotel in joining or
not joining a labor organization or
membership with a labor organization shall not constitute grounds for
discriminatory or disparate treatment nor adversely impact a potential employee’s ability to be hired.
3. In the event the operator of the
hotel located on the Property is
found to have failed to perform or
observe the conditions set forth
above in Section 1. or 2. as evidenced by either: (i) a final judgment or order of the National Labor
Relations Board or court of competent jurisdiction, which final judgment or order is not subject to further appeal, or (ii) a finding by the
City of Cleveland as set forth in a
written notice of default sent by the
City’s Director of Economic Development, the Redeveloper shall, within thirty (30) days after such judgment or order becomes final (or
within such longer period as may be
reasonably required), or within thirty (30) days (or within such longer
period
as
may
be
reasonably
required) after City’s sending of the
notice of default:
a. Cause such hotel operator to
comply with such order or judgment
and any remedial action required
thereunder;
b. If the hotel operator does not
comply with Section 3.a. within the
time periods set forth therein, the
Redeveloper can terminate the contract of such hotel operator to operate such hotel and obtain a qualified replacement hotel operator who
will operate in conformity with the
above requirements.
In the event Redeveloper fails to
comply with its requirements set
forth in this Section 3. the loan
agreement shall be terminated as of
the date of such failure. Also as of
the date of such failure, the Redeveloper shall be required to reimburse the City for all taxes the City
would have received but for the
TIF.”.
Section 10. That it is hereby found
and determined that all formal
actions of this Council concerning
and relating to the passage of this
Ordinance were adopted in open
meetings of this Council, and any of
its committees that resulted in such
formal action were in meetings open
to the public in compliance with the
law.
Section 11. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
