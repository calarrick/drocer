FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 2187-99.
By Councilmen Brady, Britt, Cimperman, Cintron, Coats, Dolan, Gordon, Jackson, Johnson, Jones, Lewis,
Melena, O’Malley, Patmon, Polensek,
Robinson, Rybka, Sweeney, Westbrook, White and Willis.
An emergency resolution urging
Home Depot to utilize and employ
Cleveland construction firms and
workers in the construction and
remodeling of its stores in the Cleveland area.
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
has
continually
recognized
and
championed the rights of laborers in
the City of Cleveland and, by passage of numerous resolutions, Council has acknowledged the right of
employees to seek safe, fair and productive working conditions and to
be paid equitably for their hard
work; and
Whereas, Council has, by passage
of numerous ordinances and resolutions, emphasized the importance of
hiring residents of the City to construct and ultimately staff the many
new stores, developments and industries throughout Cleveland, particularly those projects that receive
financial assistance from the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, the hiring of local laborers to construct projects in the City
benefits not only those local workers, but also serves to benefit the
entire community by generating
additional payroll dollars and taxes;
and
Whereas, Home Depot is a major
retailer that is seeking to rapidly
expand
its
business
throughout
Northern Ohio and Cleveland; and
Whereas, Home Depot fails to hire
local area construction workers to
build and remodel their stores and
instead brings in laborers in from
out of state; and
Whereas, Home Depot’s current
construction program is violating
our
community
standards
and
threatens the standard of living of
the citizens of Cleveland; and
Whereas, it is the goal of Cleveland City Council to protect and
maintain the highest possible standard of living for residents of Cleveland through ensuring jobs for
Clevelanders; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges Home Depot
to utilize and employ Cleveland construction firms and workers in the
construction and remodeling of its
stores in the Cleveland area, and
that such workers be paid at or
above the prevailing wage rates and
benefit levels.
Section 2. That the Council urges
Home Depot to negotiate a resolution of this issue with the Cleveland
Building Trades Council.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
