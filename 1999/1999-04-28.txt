Whereas, this Council, through

Whereas, the Firearms Heritage

Whereas, Senator Frank Lautenberg has introduced legislation, Senate Bill 686, that allows local and
state governments to sue gun manufacturers for costs associated with
treating victims of crimes in which
firearms

with
such
amount estimated to be $20 billion

now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland is supportive of

White, Willis and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
AMPCO and APCOA to permit a
union representation campaign by
Teamsters Local No. 507 to be conducted in an open, fair environment.
Whereas,
through
passage
of
numerous resolutions, this Council
of the City of Cleveland has recognized the right of employees to
seek
safe,
fair
and
productive
working conditions and to be remunerated equitably for their hard
work; and
Whereas, Teamsters Local Union
No. 507 currently represents approximately 3200 active and 900 retired
members in many industries, including more than 100 parking employees hired by APCOA and a small
group of parking employees hired
by AMPCO; and
Whereas, the parking industry is
extremely lucrative, with AMPCO
generating over $760 million in
annual sales in 1992, over $1 billion
in annual sales in 1996, and over
$1.25 billion in annual sales in 1998;
and
Whereas, these phenomenal annual profits fail to trickle down to the
parking attendants actually performing
the
work,
with
such
employees working in adverse conditions and in inclement weather
while receiving low wages and inadequate health insurance coverage;
and
Whereas, AMPCO employees are
working under union contracts in
other cities and this Council of the
City of Cleveland encourages such
open-mindedness
by
AMPCO
in
Cleveland, now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland is supportive of
safe, productive working conditions

distance between such wall, fence or hedge and an existing or potential main building on an adjoining lot, above
such grade level in another location, and further providing that all fences shall be erected so that the finished
side faces out toward adjoining properties or streets, and the unfinished side, if any, faces toward the interior
of the property on which such fence is to be erected. It is further provided that in the case of any parking lot
authorized by ordinance or a variance granted thereon, an educational, religious, medical, community service or

to the construction of the main building only if:
(1) The accessory building is erected on the rear half of the lot.
(2) The accessory building is so placed as not to prevent the practicable and conforming location of the main
building.

encroachments shall be permitted.
(a) Underground Garage or Accessory Space in Multi-Family Districts. Within the required yard spaces back
of the setback building line in a Multi-Family District an underground garage or other accessory space may be
constructed provided the height of such structure, including parapets, piers or railings, shall not exceed five feet
above the grade level, and provided such structure does not prevent free access to the rear yard.
(b) Front Yard and Side Street Yard Encroachments. Except as restricted or limited by other provisions of this
Zoning Code, the following front yard and side street yard encroachments shall be permitted in any use district:
(1) Front yard and side street yard encroachments permitted under Chapter 3109, and Chapter 3113, except that
in a Dwelling House District no entrance canopy shall be erected, and no marquees or fixed or retractable awning
shall project more than six feet beyond the building line or within ten feet of the street line.
(2) Steps and landings, and their appurtenant railings, balustrades and parapets, leading up or down to floor
levels directly above or below the grade level.

a public or private playground or any other area or structure which is the property of any agency or branch of

and 357.14 of this Zoning Code, the Board of Zoning Appeals may, after public notice and hearing, permit the
erection of structures between the street line and setback building line if such structures are needed to provide
protection from crime for the occupants of a building or for property at a building. The Board shall determine
if the proposed structures are needed by taking into account security conditions in the neighborhood, including
the feasibility of alternative means of security, and by considering any detrimental effect the proposed structures
will have on the property itself or on the neighborhood and any positive or mitigating effect created by the
installation of landscaping or other design features which are not required by this code. The Board may approve
a proposed design in part if the Board finds that only that part meets the requirements of this section. However, when in the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, the proposed corner fence will not block lines of sight
and will be constructed of such material such as to not block lines of sight such as a metal chain link, he or
she shall issue a permit for such corner fence provided that the fence shall not exceed fifty-four inches.
(4) Open porticos or porches projecting not more than six feet, enclosed porches or vestibules projecting not
more than four feet and balconies projecting not more than three feet, provided they do not extend within ten
feet of the street line and do not aggregate a vertical area in any story more than twenty percent of the area
of the facade in that story.
(5) Structures permitted by division (a) of Section 3113.10, division (a) of Section 3113.13 and Section 3113.16 or
where not so permitted, gasoline pump islands, sign poles or similar temporary and easily removable structures,
provided that conditional and temporary permits therefor are granted, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards by the Board after public notice and public hearing, and provided, further, that the erection, maintenance
and use thereof do not conflict with the intent and purposes of this Zoning Code.
(c) Rear Yard and Interior Side Yard Encroachments. Except as restricted or limited by other provisions of this
Zoning Code, the following rear yard and interior side yard encroachments shall be permitted in any use district:
(1) In rear yards only, accessory buildings and uses in connection with Residence Occupancy as defined and
limited in Section 337.23, and similar accessory buildings and uses in connection with buildings of Institutional
H Occupancy Classification. Accessory buildings or uses attached or forming part of a main building shall be
permitted to encroach upon such rear yards to the extent permitted for detached accessory buildings or uses.
(2) Projections for architectural embellishment listed in Section 3109.08, provided that no main cornice or eaves
shall project into a required yard more than two feet, measured horizontally, and no bar or oriel shall be constructed in a required interior side yard and none shall project into a required rear yard more than eighteen
inches, and no other projection shall exceed the maximum permissible projection specified in Section 3109.08 or

(3) Fixed awnings, as permitted by Section 3109.10.
(4) Retractable awnings, as permitted by Section 3109.11.
(5) Steps, landings and their appurtenant railings, balustrades and parapets, leading up or down to floor levels directly above or below the grade level, not extending nearer than one foot to a rear or side lot line.
