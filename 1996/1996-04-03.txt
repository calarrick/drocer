Ord. No. 552-96.
By Councilmen Rybka, McGuirk and Rokakis (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting new Section 337.031; to amend said Codified Ordinances by amending Sections 325.59, 335.01 and 335.04, as amended by
various ordinances; and to repeal Section 309.25, as amended by Ordinance No. 86-85, passed February 25, 1985,
all relating to town houses.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are hereby supplemented by enacting new Section 337.031 thereof, to read as follows:
Section 337.031 Townhouse (RA) Districts
(a) Purpose. Townhouse Districts (i.e., Residential Attached districts) are established to provide sites for lowrise development of attached residential units at medium to high densities. Such developments are intended to
serve as a transition between areas of detached residences and areas of higher intensity development or to serve
as a means of clustering housing units on sites which can be developed most appropriately through such clustering.
(b) Definitions. A “townhouse unit” is a single dwelling unit, situated at ground level, served by its own exclusive exterior entrance, and attached to one or more other such units by fire walls or fire separation walls. A
“townhouse building” is a building composed of two or more townhouse units. The terms “townhouse” and “row
house” shall have the same meaning unless otherwise indicated.
(c) Permitted Uses. In a Townhouse District, permitted uses are limited to townhouse buildings and all main
and accessory uses permitted and as regulated in Two-Family Districts. However, notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 355.05 regarding existing lots of record, lots established for development of attached residences shall
not be developed or redeveloped for detached residences unless such lots meet all prevailing regulations applicable to the development of detached residences.
(d) Ownership. Townhouse units may be in condominium ownership, where two or more units are located on
a single lot, or in a type of ownership where each unit is located on a separate lot. Each townhouse development shall conform to the regulations applicable to its form of ownership.
(e) District Establishment. The following Townhouse Districts are hereby established: RA-1, RA-2, and RA-3
(with the abbreviation “RA” indicating “Residential, Attached” and the numerals indicating that the districts are
listed in order of “density,” from lowest to highest).
(f) Site Planning and Design. No Building Permit shall be issued for the original construction of a townhouse
unit or townhouse building without approval of the City Planning Commission, which shall seek to ensure that
the development meets the following standards of site planning and architectural design.
(1) Compatibility. The development shall be visually compatible with nearby properties with respect to such
design elements as scale, height, setback, orientation to existing streets, open spaces, roof lines, architectural
style, materials, colors, and proportions of architectural features. Furthermore, the development shall not adversely affect the use of nearby properties with respect to such factors as pedestrian and vehicular access, privacy,
safety, and obstructions to light and air.
(2) Site Layout. Buildings, structures and landscape features shall be arranged so as to create visual interest,
avoid monotony, maximize privacy, conserve natural features, minimize the need for grading, provide for usable
areas of common and private open space, facilitate efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and promote
security and personal safety.
(3) Building Design. Townhouse units shall be designed so as to create visual interest and differentiate individual units through variations in roof lines, wall setbacks and building materials or through use of porches,
bay windows, and other projecting elements. Garages shall be placed to the rear of the residential units or, if
located in the front of units, shall be designed and placed in a manner which reduces their visual prominence.
(4) Circulation and Parking. Circulation and parking shall be designed in a manner which provides proper
access for service and safety vehicles, minimizes conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles, minimizes the number of curb cuts onto major streets, avoids placing excessive traffic on local residential streets, avoids unenclosed parking in front yards, and avoids placement of garage doors so close to sidewalks as to impair pedestrian safety.

(g) Area and Yard~Regulations. The following yard and area regulations shall apply to townhouse developments in RA-1, RA-2, and RA-3 Districts and in other zoning districts which permit townhouse development. All
figures are minimum requirements unless otherwise stated. The City Planning Commission may require greater
restrictions as necessary to meet the standards of division (f). For main buildings other than townhouses and
for accessory uses and structures, regulations of the Two-Family District shall apply.

a combination of land and water of such condition, size, shape and location as to be usable for active recreation
and/or scenic enjoyment by the residents of the townhouse development, as determined by the City Planning
Commission. Common open space shall not include driveways, parking areas or structures other than those structures devoted to recreational use. The applicant shall provide, to the Commissioner of Building and Housing, evidence of legally enforceable mechanisms to ensure perpetual preservation of such land as common open space
and to ensure proper maintenance.
(i) Easements for Zero Lot Line Buildings. Where the City Planning Commission determines that provision of
an easement is necessary to ensure proper access, light and air to a building placed directly on a lot line, the
Commission may require provision of such easement as a condition of the issuance of a Building Permit for construction of the zero-lot-line building. The easement shall be shown on the recorded plat and incorporated into
each deed transferring title to the property.
(j) Variations from Area and Yard Regulations. The Board of Zoning Appeals may approve variations from
area and yard regulations applicable to townhouse developments if the Board determines that such variations
are necessary to achieve an appropriate development of the site and that such variations will not result in safety or health hazards and will not be injurious to the use or value of nearby properties. In making such a determination, the Board shall consider a recommendation made by the City Planning Commission on the basis of the
site plan and design review conducted in accordance with the provisions of division (f) of this section.

An emergency resolution objecting to the issuance of a C1 Liquor

#4536, 2780 East 116th Street and
gas pumps, Cleveland, Ohio 44120;
and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor

Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
safety and welfare pursuant to Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised

of notification; now, therefore,
