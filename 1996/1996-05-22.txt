for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, property, health
and safety, and for the usual daily
operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed Eighteen Million Six Hundred and Five Thousand Dollars
($18,605,000) for the purpose of providing funds to improve the municipal street system and related facilities,
including
streets,
expressways,
roadways,
driveways
and
pedestrian walkways, by acquiring,
constructing, reconstructing, opening, extending, widening, grading,
draining, paving, lighting and curbing, installing gutters, sidewalks
and
related
pedestrian
improvements, resetting and constructing
catch
basins
and
other
storm
drainage
facilities,
constructing,
reconstructing, renovating and rehabilitating bridges, acquiring any
real estate and interests in real
estate, including easements, necessary for such purpose and installing
signs, signals, markings and other
devices for traffic control purposes,
together with off-street parking lot
improvements to facilitate the flow
of traffic, and together with the
payment of all associated preliminary and computerization costs and
costs of site clearance and all
appurtenances necessary and incidental thereto, and to pay all
expenses incurred in connection
with the issuance of the Bonds,
including any financing costs within the meaning of Revised Code Section 133.01(K), and to pay capitalized interest and such other costs of
the foregoing permanent improvements that may be financed with
the proceeds of securities as permitted by Revised Code Section
133.15(B) and as otherwise permitted by law; and to authorize the
issuance of notes in anticipation of
such bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised

The City Record
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated
“Bridges
and
Roadways
Improvement Bonds, Series 1996”.
The Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
July 1, 1996 or such other date, but
in no event later than December 31,
1996, specified in the certificate of
award providing for the final terms
of the Bonds and the sale of the
Bonds and signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate of nine percent
(9%) per year or at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on March 1
and September 1 of each year or on
the first day of each of two months
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on
the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning September 1, 1996 or on such
other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature on September 1 in nineteen (19) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning September 1, 1996, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date (hereinafter defined), (ii) the
first
principal
payment
on
the
Bonds shall be no earlier than September 1, 1996 and no later than
August 1, 1998, (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than nineteen (19) years from
the first principal payment date,
and (iv) the principal amount thereof shall be payable in annual
installments such that the total
principal and interest payments on
the Bonds in any fiscal year in
which principal is payable is not
more than three times the amount
of those payments in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date

911

13
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the
principal
amount
thereof
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation). Any excess
of that amount over the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement shall be
credited against subsequent Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligations)
in the order directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, provided that the earliest

14
date for such optional redemption
shall be no later than the tenth
anniversary of the first principal
payment date and the maximum
redemption price shall be no greater
than 102% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued interest to
the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or

The City Record
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held by the Registrar for the
redemption
of
particular
Bonds
shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
thereof and shall be paid to them,
respectively, upon presentation and
surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the fifteenth day of the calendar
month next preceding that Interest
Payment Date (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are held
by a Depository in a book entry system (as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the
United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow

912

May 22, 1996
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee. The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor
and
by
the
City’s
Director
of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council. The Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent

May 22, 1996
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Bonds in accordance with the provisions
of
this
ordinance.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Bonds issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this ordinance, as the Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the

The City Record
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants
or otherwise, a book entry system
to record ownership of beneficial
interests in Bonds or the principal
and interest, and to effect transfers
of Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the form
of a single, fully registered Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository and any other arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall
permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also

913

15
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
such Trustees, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
by such Account, shall be sold to
Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of Law
and other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript or proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of

16
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the
Clerk,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this Ordinance
and not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those officers in their official capacities are authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of
the City an Official Statement and
any necessary supplements thereto,
and on behalf of the City to use and
distribute, or authorize the use and
distribution of, that Official Statement and any supplements thereto
in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, and each of
those officers is authorized to sign
on behalf of the City and in his or
her official capacity, that Official
Statement
and
any
supplements
thereto approved by such officer.
Those officers are and each of them
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements thereto as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate.
Such officers are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their

The City Record
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of
the occurrence of any other events,
the Director of Finance shall consult with, as appropriate, the legal
counsel and bond or other qualified
independent special counsel to the
City. The Director of Finance, acting in the name and on behalf of
the City, shall be entitled to rely
upon any legal advice provided by
any such counsel in determining
whether a filing should be made.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be
designated
“Various
Purpose
General Obligation Bonds, Series
1996”. Such bonds shall contain a
summary
statement
of
purposes
encompassing the purpose for which
the Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when

purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,

sale of the Bonds shall be deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund to be applied to the payment

City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or

all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further

City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and

deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:

or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,

or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this

of
the
issuance of the Bonds for the purposes set forth in Section 1 hereof,
notes of the City may be issued in
an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed Eighteen Million Six Hundred and Five Thousand Dollars
($18,605,000) (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance
to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of the
Notes and the sale of the Notes and
signed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
Section 10. Term of the Notes. The

(9%) per year, as may be fixed by
the Director of Finance of the City
in the Note Certificate of Award;

Award, which shall be no later than
five (5) years from such date of

to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of the
financial advisor of the City, determines that it is in the best interest
of the City in order to enhance the
marketability of the Notes, the
Director of Finance may cause the
Notes to not be redeemable for a
period which ends no later than the
date which is two (2) years following the date of issuance of the
Notes; shall be designated “Bridges
and Roadways Improvement Bond
Anticipation

Series

shall be issued in such numbers and

The City Record
denominations as may be requested
by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter
defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be
in a book entry only system) in
denominations of $5,000 or integral
multiples thereof. Interest shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; provided that if the Notes
mature on or before the end of the
twelfth (12th) month following their
date of issuance, interest on the
Notes shall be payable at maturity.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the Registrar);
provided that the Escrow Agent
also shall act as paying agent for
the Notes so long as the Notes are
held in a book entry system. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among
the City, the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent (the Note Registrar
Agreement) providing for services
relating to the registration, transfer,
exchange and payment of Notes.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Note Registrar Agreement from the
proceeds of the Notes to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Notes as provided in
this Section (the Note Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Note
is registered on the Note Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Note for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Note shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Note, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.

915

17
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General
Obligation
Bond
Anticipation
Notes, Series 1996”. The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a
facsimile.
Such
Notes
shall
express upon their face the purpose
for which they are issued and that
they are issued pursuant to this
ordinance, and may be payable in
Federal Reserve funds of the United States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate
of Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold
to Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc., and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (the “Note
Purchaser”). The proceeds of such
sale shall be paid into the proper
fund and used for the purpose for
which the Notes are being issued
under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year

18
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or
any other appropriate disclosure
document of the City in accordance
with the sale and delivery of the
Notes, and to deem such disclosure
document “final” for purposes of
SEC Rule 15c2-12.

this Ordinance and the General
Bond Ordinance shall not apply to
the Bonds or the Notes authorized
herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance are fully applicable to the

The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory

20
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the
principal
amount
thereof
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation). Any excess
of that amount over the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement shall be
credited against subsequent Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligations)
in the order directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, provided that the earliest
date for such optional redemption
shall be no later than the tenth
anniversary of the first principal
payment date and the maximum
redemption price shall be no greater
than 102% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued interest to
the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Reg-

The City Record
istrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest

918

May 22, 1996
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held by the Registrar for the
redemption
of
particular
Bonds
shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
thereof and shall be paid to them,
respectively, upon presentation and
surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the fifteenth day of the calendar
month next preceding that Interest
Payment Date (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are held
by a Depository in a book entry system (as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the
United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Pur-

May 22, 1996
suant to Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee. The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor
and
by
the
City’s
Director
of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council. The Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together

The City Record
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Bonds in accordance with the provisions
of
this
ordinance.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Bonds issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this ordinance, as the Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants
or otherwise, a book entry system
to record ownership of beneficial
interests in Bonds or the principal
and interest, and to effect transfers
of Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and deal-

919

21
ers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the form
of a single, fully registered Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository and any other arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall
permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
such Trustees, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
by such Account, shall be sold to
Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to

22
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of Law
and other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript or proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the
Clerk,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this Ordinance
and not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those officers in their official capacities are authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of
the City an Official Statement and

The City Record
any necessary supplements thereto,
and on behalf of the City to use and
distribute, or authorize the use and
distribution of, that Official Statement and any supplements thereto
in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, and each of
those officers is authorized to sign
on behalf of the City and in his or
her official capacity, that Official
Statement
and
any
supplements
thereto approved by such officer.
Those officers are and each of them
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements thereto as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate.
Such officers are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of
the occurrence of any other events,
the Director of Finance shall consult with, as appropriate, the legal
counsel and bond or other qualified
independent special counsel to the
City. The Director of Finance, acting in the name and on behalf of
the City, shall be entitled to rely
upon any legal advice provided by
any such counsel in determining
whether a filing should be made.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be
designated
“Various
Purpose
General Obligation Bonds, Series
1996”. Such bonds shall contain a
summary
statement
of
purposes
encompassing the purpose for which
the Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.

May 22, 1996
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended
and
applied
for
the
objects and purposes for which the
Bonds are issued. Accrued interest
and any premium received from the
sale of the Bonds shall be deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund to be applied to the payment
of the principal of and interest on
the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General Bond Ordinance and, in addition
to the taxes and revenues specifically pledged pursuant to this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds, the City hereby determines,
declares, warrants and covenants

May 22, 1996
that the Bonds are general obligations of the City and that the full
faith and credit of the City are hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds in accordance with the laws
and Constitution of the State of
Ohio, this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations of the United States certified
by an independent public accounting firm of national reputation to be
of such maturities and interest payment dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or
reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be
sufficient, together with moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on
the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be,
or if default in such payment shall

act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the Registrar);
provided that the Escrow Agent
also shall act as paying agent for
the Notes so long as the Notes are
held in a book entry system. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among
the City, the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent (the Note Registrar
Agreement) providing for services
relating to the registration, transfer,
exchange and payment of Notes.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Note Registrar Agreement from the

921

23
proceeds of the Notes to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Notes as provided in
this Section (the Note Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Note
is registered on the Note Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Note for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Note shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Note, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City.
In all cases of Notes exchanged or
transferred, the City shall sign and
the Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver Notes in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance. The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Notes issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this ordinance, as the Notes
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidat-

24
ed issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General

purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a
facsimile.
Such
Notes
shall
express upon their face the purpose
for which they are issued and that
they are issued pursuant to this
ordinance, and may be payable in
Federal Reserve funds of the United States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate

exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold
to Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc., and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (the “Note

sale shall be paid into the proper
fund and used for the purpose for
which the Notes are being issued
under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are

The City Record

amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or

it will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Bonds in such

and the Bonds will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under

other than as bonds to which Section 103(a) of the Code applies, and
(b) the interest thereon will not be
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and (b) it
will not take or authorize to be
taken
any
actions
that
would

among other acts of compliance, (i)
apply the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records
and make calculations and reports,

(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications

Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant

133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised

The Bonds shall be dated as of
July 1, 1996 or such other date, but
in no event later than December 31,
1996, specified in the certificate of
award providing for the final terms
of the Bonds and the sale of the
Bonds and signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate of nine percent
(9%) per year or at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on March 1
and September 1 of each year or on
the first day of each of two months
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on
the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning September 1, 1996 or on such
other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature on September 1 in twenty (20) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning September 1, 1996, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date (hereinafter defined), (ii) the
first
principal
payment
on
the
Bonds shall be no earlier than September 1, 1996 and no later than
August 1, 1998, (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no

The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the
principal
amount
thereof
against the then current Mandatory

The City Record
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation). Any excess
of that amount over the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement shall be
credited against subsequent Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligations)
in the order directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption.
The
Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, provided that the earliest
date for such optional redemption
shall be no later than the tenth
anniversary of the first principal
payment date and the maximum
redemption price shall be no greater
than 102% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued interest to
the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)

924

May 22, 1996
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held by the Registrar for the
redemption
of
particular
Bonds
shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
thereof and shall be paid to them,
respectively, upon presentation and
surrender of those Bonds. The debt
charges on the Bonds shall be
payable in lawful money of the
United States of America without
deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of

May 22, 1996
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the fifteenth day of the calendar
month next preceding that Interest
Payment Date (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are held
by a Depository in a book entry system (as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the
United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee. The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor
and
by
the
City’s
Director
of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,

The City Record
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council. The Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Bonds in accordance with the provisions
of
this
ordinance.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with

925

27
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Bonds issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this ordinance, as the Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants
or otherwise, a book entry system
to record ownership of beneficial
interests in Bonds or the principal
and interest, and to effect transfers
of Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the form
of a single, fully registered Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do

28
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository and any other arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall
permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
such Trustees, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
by such Account, shall be sold to
Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of Law
and other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript or proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any tran-

The City Record
script certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the
Clerk,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this Ordinance
and not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those officers in their official capacities are authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of
the City an Official Statement and
any necessary supplements thereto,
and on behalf of the City to use and
distribute, or authorize the use and
distribution of, that Official Statement and any supplements thereto
in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, and each of
those officers is authorized to sign
on behalf of the City and in his or
her official capacity, that Official
Statement
and
any
supplements
thereto approved by such officer.
Those officers are and each of them
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements thereto as may, in their
judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers are also hereby
authorized to determine and certify
on behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final”
by the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for

926

May 22, 1996
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of
the occurrence of any other events,
the Director of Finance shall consult with, as appropriate, the legal
counsel and bond or other qualified
independent special counsel to the
City. The Director of Finance, acting in the name and on behalf of
the City, shall be entitled to rely
upon any legal advice provided by
any such counsel in determining
whether a filing should be made.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be
designated
“Various
Purpose
General Obligation Bonds, Series
1996”. Such bonds shall contain a
summary
statement
of
purposes
encompassing the purpose for which
the Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on

May 22, 1996
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended
and
applied
for
the
objects and purposes for which the
Bonds are issued. Accrued interest
and any premium received from the
sale of the Bonds shall be deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund to be applied to the payment
of the principal of and interest on
the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General Bond Ordinance and, in addition
to the taxes and revenues specifically pledged pursuant to this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds, the City hereby determines,
declares, warrants and covenants
that the Bonds are general obligations of the City and that the full
faith and credit of the City are hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds in accordance with the laws
and Constitution of the State of
Ohio, this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:

The City Record
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations of the United States certified
by an independent public accounting firm of national reputation to be
of such maturities and interest payment dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or
reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be
sufficient, together with moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on
the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be,
or if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the
holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance for unclaimed funds held by
a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment
of
any
Bond
as
described in Section 17(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section
shall be held and paid as provided
in said Section 17(a) for unclaimed
funds held by a Paying Agent.
Section
9.
Bond
Anticipation

money
in
anticipation
of
the
issuance of the Bonds for the purposes set forth in Section 1 hereof,
notes of the City may be issued in
an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed Three Million One Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars
($3,160,000) (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance
to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of the
Notes and the sale of the Notes and
signed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).

Award, which shall be no later than
five (5) years from such date of

927

29
tion by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of the
financial advisor of the City, determines that it is in the best interest
of the City in order to enhance the
marketability of the Notes, the
Director of Finance may cause the
Notes to not be redeemable for a
period which ends no later than the
date which is two (2) years following the date of issuance of the
Notes; shall be designated “Public
Facilities Improvement Bond Anticipation Notes, Series 1996”; shall be
issued in such numbers and denominations as may be requested by the
Note
Purchaser
(hereinafter
defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be

multiples thereof. Interest shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; provided that if the Notes
mature on or before the end of the
twelfth (12th) month following their
date of issuance, interest on the
Notes shall be payable at maturity.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the Registrar);
provided that the Escrow Agent
also shall act as paying agent for
the Notes so long as the Notes are
held in a book entry system. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among
the City, the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent (the Note Registrar
Agreement) providing for services
relating to the registration, transfer,
exchange and payment of Notes.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Note Registrar Agreement from the
proceeds of the Notes to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Notes as provided in
this Section (the Note Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Note
is registered on the Note Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Note for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Note shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Note, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation

30
and surrender of the Note at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General
Obligation
Bond
Anticipation
Notes, Series 1996”. The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a
facsimile.
Such
Notes
shall
express upon their face the purpose
for which they are issued and that
they are issued pursuant to this
ordinance, and may be payable in
Federal Reserve funds of the United States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate
of Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold
to Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc., and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (the “Note
Purchaser”). The proceeds of such
sale shall be paid into the proper
fund and used for the purpose for
which the Notes are being issued
under the provisions of this Ordinance.

The City Record
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or
any other appropriate disclosure
document of the City in accordance
with the sale and delivery of the
Notes, and to deem such disclosure
document “final” for purposes of
SEC Rule 15c2-12.
Section 16. Miscellaneous.
(a) Any provisions of the Codified
Ordinances of the City which are
inconsistent with the provisions of
this Ordinance and the General
Bond Ordinance shall not apply to
the Bonds or the Notes authorized
herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance are fully applicable to the
Bonds and the Notes authorized
herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to alter or
restrict such full application of the
General Bond Ordinance, except for

herein of the provisions of the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 of the

18.
Federal
Tax
Covenants. The City covenants that
it will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the Notes
and the Bonds will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii) be treated
other than as bonds to which Section 103(a) of the Code applies, and
(b) the interest thereon will not be
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and (b) it
will not take or authorize to be
taken
any
actions
that
would
adversely affect that exclusion, and
(c) it, or persons acting for it, will,
among other acts of compliance, (i)
apply the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records
and make calculations and reports,
and (v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds, and, as applicable,
of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Notes and
the Bonds is also made with respect
to all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Notes or the Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Notes
and the Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for

is hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds
as the City is permitted or required
to make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Notes and
the Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making

May 22, 1996
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclusion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes
and the Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances
relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds.

By

and
Rokakis (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance for the
issuance and sale of bonds in the
maximum

of
$4,955,000 for the purpose of providing funds to improve municipal
recreation facilities, to pay capitalized interest and to pay all expenses incurred in connection with the
issuance of the bonds; to authorize

Thousand Dollars ($4,955,000) (the
“Bonds”) to finance the cost of certain
permanent

described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least

1980, and thereafter amended that
ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed on May 6, 1983 (Ordinance
No. 1749-80, as so amended and as
the same may further be amended
from time to time in accordance
with its provisions, is referred to as
the “General Bond Ordinance”), providing the general terms and provisions for the issuance thereunder of
unvoted general obligations of the
City and the General Bond Ordinance was passed in contemplation
of this Ordinance and other ordinances authorizing the issuance of
bonds in accordance with the provisions thereof (the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to pay the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1, which are urgently needed
for the benefit of the City, and as
a result, this Ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing
for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, property, health
and safety, and for the usual daily
operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed Four Million Nine Hundred
and Fifty-five Thousand Dollars
($4,955,000) for the purpose of providing funds to improve municipal
recreation facilities by constructing,
reconstructing,
rehabilitating,
remodeling, renovating, enlarging
and
otherwise
improving
pools,
recreation centers and other buildings, structures and facilities, providing necessary furnishings, equipment and site improvements, together with all necessary and incidental
appurtenances, in all cases, including the acquisition of any required
real estate and interests in real
estate, and to pay capitalized interest and to pay all expenses incurred
in connection with the issuance of
the Bonds, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section
133.01(K) of the Revised Code and
such other costs of the foregoing
permanent improvements that may
be financed with the proceeds of
securities as permitted by Section
133.15(B) of the Revised Code and
as permitted by law; and to authorize the issuance of notes in anticipation of such bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated
“Recreational
Facilities
Improvement Bonds, Series 1996”.
The Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
July 1, 1996 or such other date, but
in no event later than December 31,
1996, specified in the certificate of
award providing for the final terms
of the Bonds and the sale of the
Bonds and signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear

32
interest at the rate of nine percent
(9%) per year or at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on March 1
and September 1 of each year or on
the first day of each of two months
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on
the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning September 1, 1996 or on such
other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature on September 1 in twenty (20) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning September 1, 1996, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date (hereinafter defined), (ii) the
first
principal
payment
on
the
Bonds shall be no earlier than September 1, 1996 and no later than
August 1, 1998, (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than twenty (20) years from
the first principal payment date,
and (iv) the principal amount thereof shall be payable in annual
installments such that the total
principal and interest payments on
the Bonds in any fiscal year in
which principal is payable is not
more than three times the amount
of those payments in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates

The City Record
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the
principal
amount
thereof
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation). Any excess
of that amount over the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement shall be
credited against subsequent Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligations)
in the order directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, provided that the earliest
date for such optional redemption
shall be no later than the tenth
anniversary of the first principal
payment date and the maximum
redemption price shall be no greater
than 102% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued interest to
the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by pas-

930

May 22, 1996
sage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond.

May 22, 1996
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held by the Registrar for the
redemption
of
particular
Bonds
shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
thereof and shall be paid to them,
respectively, upon presentation and
surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the fifteenth day of the calendar
month next preceding that Interest
Payment Date (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are held
by a Depository in a book entry system (as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the
United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein

The City Record
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee. The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor
and
by
the
City’s
Director
of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council. The Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.

All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Bonds in accordance with the provisions
of
this
ordinance.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Bonds issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this ordinance, as the Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants
or otherwise, a book entry system
to record ownership of beneficial

34
interests in Bonds or the principal
and interest, and to effect transfers
of Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the form
of a single, fully registered Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository and any other arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall
permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
such Trustees, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
by such Account, shall be sold to
Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).

The City Record
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of Law
and other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript or proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the
Clerk,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this Ordinance
and not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as pro-

932

May 22, 1996
vided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those officers in their official capacities are authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of
the City an Official Statement and
any necessary supplements thereto,
and on behalf of the City to use and
distribute, or authorize the use and
distribution of, that Official Statement and any supplements thereto
in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, and each of
those officers is authorized to sign
on behalf of the City and in his or
her official capacity, that Official
Statement
and
any
supplements
thereto approved by such officer.
Those officers are and each of them
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements thereto as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate.
Such officers are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of
the occurrence of any other events,
the Director of Finance shall consult with, as appropriate, the legal
counsel and bond or other qualified
independent special counsel to the
City. The Director of Finance, acting in the name and on behalf of
the City, shall be entitled to rely
upon any legal advice provided by

May 22, 1996
any such counsel in determining
whether a filing should be made.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be
designated
“Various
Purpose
General Obligation Bonds, Series
1996”. Such bonds shall contain a
summary
statement
of
purposes
encompassing the purpose for which
the Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio. The tax shall be
and is hereby ordered computed, certified, levied and extended upon the
tax duplicate and collected by the
same officers, in the same manner
and at the same time that taxes for
general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and
collected. The tax shall be placed
before and in preference to all other
items and for the full amount thereof. The funds derived from the tax
levies hereby required shall be
placed in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to
the General Bond Ordinance which,
together with the interest collected
on the same, shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds
when and as the same fall due; provided, however, that, subject to the
provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in each year
to the extent that revenues are
available from other sources for the
payment of the Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such tax shall be reduced
by the amount of such revenues so
available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended
and
applied
for
the
objects and purposes for which the
Bonds are issued. Accrued interest
and any premium received from the
sale of the Bonds shall be deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund to be applied to the payment
of the principal of and interest on
the Bonds.

The City Record
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General Bond Ordinance and, in addition
to the taxes and revenues specifically pledged pursuant to this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds, the City hereby determines,
declares, warrants and covenants
that the Bonds are general obligations of the City and that the full
faith and credit of the City are hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds in accordance with the laws
and Constitution of the State of
Ohio, this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations of the United States certified
by an independent public accounting firm of national reputation to be
of such maturities and interest
payment dates and to bear such
interest, without further investment
or reinvestment of either the principal amount thereof or the interest
earnings therefrom (likewise to be
held in trust and committed, except
as hereinafter provided), as will be
sufficient, together with moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on
the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be,
or if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in

933

35
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the
holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance for unclaimed funds held by
a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment
of
any
Bond
as
described in Section 17(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section
shall be held and paid as provided
in said Section 17(a) for unclaimed
funds held by a Paying Agent.

act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the Registrar);
provided that the Escrow Agent
also shall act as paying agent for
the Notes so long as the Notes are
held in a book entry system. The

36

deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among
the City, the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent (the Note Registrar
Agreement) providing for services
relating to the registration, transfer,

So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust

this Section (the Note Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section

is registered on the Note Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Note for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any

Note, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together

exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar

transfer of Notes only after the new

officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes

The City Record
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General
Obligation
Bond
Anticipation
Notes, Series 1996”. The Notes shall

purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a
facsimile.
Such
Notes
shall
express upon their face the purpose
for which they are issued and that
they are issued pursuant to this
ordinance, and may be payable in
Federal Reserve funds of the United States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate
of Award”) at not less than par and

10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold
to Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc., and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (the “Note

are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby

934

of
the
public,
peace, property, health and safety,
and for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed Forty-Five Million Dollars
($45,000,000) for the purpose of
advance refunding the Refunded
Bonds
which,
collectively,
were
issued for the purposes of providing
funds to pay costs of Projects 1
through 26 as described above,
including
the
payment
of
any
expenses relating to the advance
refunding of the Refunded Bonds
and the issuance of the Bonds,
including all financing costs within
the meaning of Revised Code Section 133.15(B).
The aggregate principal amount
of Bonds to be issued shall not
exceed $45,000,000 and shall be in an
amount determined by the Director
of Finance to be the aggregate principal amount of Bonds that are
required to be issued, taking into
account
any
discount
from
the
aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds at which they are sold to the
Original Purchaser, in order to
effect the purpose for which the
Bonds are to be issued, including
the payment of any expenses relating to the advance refunding of the
Refunded Bonds and the issuance of
the Bonds, which amount shall be
set forth in the certificate providing
for the final terms of the Bonds and
the sale of the Bonds and signed by
the Director of Finance in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”). The Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that additional
maturities or different maturities of
the series of unvoted general obligation bonds of the City identified in
the preambles of this Ordinance and
issued for the purpose of providing
funds to pay costs of Projects 1
through 26 may be refunded and
thereby constitute Refunded Bonds;
provided that in adding or changing
such maturities the Director of
Finance determines, based on written advice from the City’s financial
advisor, that advance refunding
such maturities generates present
value debt service savings to the
City or otherwise is in the best
interests of the City, taking into
account all the factors that the
Director of Finance and the City’s
financial advisor deem relevant to
such determination.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Revised
Code Chapter 133 and other applicable provisions of the Revised Code,
the Charter of the City, the General Bond Ordinance and this Ordinance in the principal amount and
for the purpose stated in Section 1.
The Bonds shall be designated
“Refunding Bonds, Series 1996”. The
Bonds shall be issued in one lot as
fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof but in no case as to a
particular maturity date exceeding
the principal amount maturing on

40
that date. The Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
July 1, 1996 or such other date specified in the Certificate of Award,
but in no event later than December 31, 1996. The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate of nine percent
(9%) per year or at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on March 1
and September 1 of each year or on
the first day of each of two months
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on
the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning September 1, 1996, or on such
other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date. The
Bonds shall bear interest from the
most recent date to which interest
has been paid or provided for or, if
no interest has been paid or provided for, from their date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as
shall be determined by the Director
of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i)
each principal payment shall occur
on an Interest Payment Date, (ii)
the first principal payment on the
Bonds shall be no earlier than September 1, 1996 and no later than
September 1, 1998, (iii) the final
maturity date of the Bonds shall be
no later than the last maturity permitted by law for the Refunded
Bonds,
and
(iv)
the
principal
amount thereof shall be payable in
annual installments such that the
total principal and interest payments on the Bonds in any fiscal
year in which principal is payable,
is not more than three times the
amount of those payments for the
Refunded Bonds in any fiscal year
in which principal was payable on
the Refunded Bonds.
The Director of Finance also shall
determine, in the Certificate of
Award or otherwise, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Bonds to
the Original Purchaser, that portion
of the aggregate principal amount
of the Bonds that is allocable to
each Project, and the principal
amount of Bonds allocated to each
Project that shall be payable annually at stated maturity or pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(as
defined below) on each principal
payment date; provided, that (i) the
aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds allocable to a Project shall
be determined by the Director of
Finance on a pro rata basis by reference to the respective amount of
funds that is required for the
advance refunding of the Refunded
Bonds that are allocable to that Project, taking into account any funds
other than the proceeds of the
Bonds that are available and appropriated for that purpose, (ii) no portion of the aggregate principal
amount of Bonds allocated to a Project shall be payable later than the

The City Record
maximum maturity for that portion
of the Bonds as certified by the
Director of Finance, and (iii) a portion of the aggregate principal
amount of Bonds allocated to a Project shall be payable annually at
stated maturity or pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements on each principal
payment date on which the Director
of Finance determines in the Certificate of Award or otherwise that
principal of Bonds allocated to that
Project shall be payable.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund

938

May 22, 1996
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the
principal
amount
thereof
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation).
Any excess of that amount over
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
shall be credited against subsequent
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligations) in the order directed by the
Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, provided that the earliest
date for such optional redemption
shall be no later than the tenth
anniversary of the first principal
payment date and the maximum
redemption price shall be no greater
than 102% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued interest to
the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000

May 22, 1996
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held by the Registrar for the
redemption
of
particular
Bonds
shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners

The City Record
thereof and shall be paid to them,
respectively, upon presentation and
surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the fifteenth day of the calendar
month next preceding that Interest
Payment Date (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are held
by a Depository in a book entry system (as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the
United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee. The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor
and
by
the
City’s
Director
of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.

Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent also shall act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council. The Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized

42
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Bonds in accordance with the provisions
of
this
ordinance.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Bonds issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this ordinance, as the Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance: “Book
entry form” or “book entry system”
means a form or system under
which (i) the ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds and the principal of and interest on the Bonds
may be transferred only through a
book entry, and (ii) physical Bond
certificates in fully registered form
are issued by the City only to a
Depository or its nominee as registered owner, with the Bonds “immobilized” in the custody of the Depository. The book entry maintained by
others than the City is the record
that identifies the owners of beneficial interests in those Bonds and
that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities depository that is a clearing
agency under federal law operating
and maintaining, with its Participants or otherwise, a book entry
system to record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the
principal and interest, and to effect
transfers of Bonds, in book entry
form, and includes and means initially The Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the form
of a single, fully registered Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another

The City Record
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository and any other arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall
permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
such Trustees, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
by such Account, shall be sold to
Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp,
NatCity Investments, Inc., and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase
Agreement
including:
the
principal amount of the Bonds, the
final purchase price (which shall be
not less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), the interest
rate or rates, the amounts and years
in which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and the
portion of the principal amount of
the Bonds allocable to each Project.
If it is determined advisable by the
Director of Finance for the sale of
the Bonds, the Director of Finance
is authorized to sign agreements
with a municipal bond insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond
insurance for the Bonds that are not
materially inconsistent with this
Ordinance. The Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law and other
appropriate officers of the City are,
and each of them is, authorized and
directed to take such actions as are
necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for
delivery of the Bonds and to make

940

May 22, 1996
such arrangements as are necessary
with the Original Purchaser in order
to establish the date, location, and
procedure, and conditions for the
delivery of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and certificates, to cause
a true transcript or proceedings
with reference to the issuance of
the Bonds to be delivered to the
Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the
Clerk,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this Ordinance
and not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those officers in their official capacities are authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of
the City an Official Statement and
any necessary supplements thereto,
and on behalf of the City to use and
distribute, or authorize the use and
distribution of, that Official Statement and any supplements thereto
in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, and each of
those officers is authorized to sign
on behalf of the City and in his or
her official capacity, that Official
Statement
and
any
supplements
thereto approved by such officer.
Those officers are and each of them
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements thereto as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate.
Such officers are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time

May 22, 1996
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute an agreement made by the
City for the benefit of the holders
and beneficial owners of the Bonds
in accordance with the Rule. The
City’s performance of that agreement shall be subject to the availability of funds and their annual
appropriation to meet costs the City
would be required to incur to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of
the occurrence of any other events,
the Director of Finance shall consult with, as appropriate, the legal
counsel and bond or other qualified
independent special counsel to the
City. The Director of Finance, acting in the name and on behalf of
the City, shall be entitled to rely
upon any legal advice provided by
any such counsel in determining
whether a filing should be made.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be
designated

summary
statement
of
purposes
encompassing the purpose for which
the Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in

preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on

sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,

Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the

the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.

Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this

and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated “Convention Center Improvement Bonds, Series 1996”. The Bonds

registered Bonds in denominations
of $5,000 or any integral multiple
thereof. The Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
July 1, 1996 or such other date, but
in no event later than December 31,
1996, specified in the certificate of
award providing for the final terms
of the Bonds and the sale of the
Bonds and signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate of nine percent
(9%) per year or at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on March 1
and September 1 of each year or on
the first day of each of two months
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on
the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning September 1, 1996 or on such
other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature on September 1 in twenty-five (25) substantially
equal
annual
install-

943

45
ments, beginning September 1, 1996,
or according to the schedule set
forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date (hereinafter defined),
(ii) the first principal payment on
the Bonds shall be no earlier than
September 1, 1996 and no later than
August 1, 1998, (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than twenty-five (25) years
from the first principal payment
date, and (iv) the principal amount
thereof shall be payable in annual
installments such that the total
principal and interest payments on
the Bonds in any fiscal year in
which principal is payable is not
more than three times the amount
of those payments in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then

46
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the
principal
amount
thereof
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation). Any excess
of that amount over the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement shall be
credited against subsequent Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligations)
in the order directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, provided that the earliest
date for such optional redemption
shall be no later than the tenth
anniversary of the first principal
payment date and the maximum
redemption price shall be no greater
than 102% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued interest to
the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of

The City Record
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall

944

May 22, 1996
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held by the Registrar for the
redemption
of
particular
Bonds
shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
thereof and shall be paid to them,
respectively, upon presentation and
surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the fifteenth day of the calendar
month next preceding that Interest
Payment Date (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are held
by a Depository in a book entry system (as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the
United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee. The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor
and
by
the
City’s
Director
of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimi-

May 22, 1996
le seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council. The Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond

The City Record
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Bonds in accordance with the provisions
of
this
ordinance.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Bonds issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this ordinance, as the Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants
or otherwise, a book entry system
to record ownership of beneficial
interests in Bonds or the principal
and interest, and to effect transfers
of Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the form
of a single, fully registered Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by

945

47
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository and any other arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall
permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
such Trustees, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
by such Account, shall be sold to
Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,

48
Director of Finance, Director of Law
and other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript or proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the
Clerk,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this Ordinance
and not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those officers in their official capacities are authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of
the City an Official Statement and
any necessary supplements thereto,
and on behalf of the City to use and
distribute, or authorize the use and
distribution of, that Official Statement and any supplements thereto
in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, and each of
those officers is authorized to sign
on behalf of the City and in his or
her official capacity, that Official
Statement
and
any
supplements
thereto approved by such officer.
Those officers are and each of them
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements thereto as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate.

The City Record
Such officers are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of
the occurrence of any other events,
the Director of Finance shall consult with, as appropriate, the legal
counsel and bond or other qualified
independent special counsel to the
City. The Director of Finance, acting in the name and on behalf of
the City, shall be entitled to rely
upon any legal advice provided by
any such counsel in determining
whether a filing should be made.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be
designated
“Various
Purpose
General Obligation Bonds, Series
1996”. Such bonds shall contain a
summary
statement
of
purposes
encompassing the purpose for which
the Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.

946

May 22, 1996
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended
and
applied
for
the
objects and purposes for which the
Bonds are issued. Accrued interest
and any premium received from the
sale of the Bonds shall be deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund to be applied to the payment
of the principal of and interest on
the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General Bond Ordinance and, in addition
to the taxes and revenues specifically pledged pursuant to this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds, the City hereby determines,
declares, warrants and covenants
that the Bonds are general obligations of the City and that the full
faith and credit of the City are hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds in accordance with the laws
and Constitution of the State of
Ohio, this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) here-

May 22, 1996
of) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations of the United States certified
by an independent public accounting firm of national reputation to be
of such maturities and interest payment dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or
reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be
sufficient, together with moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on
the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be,
or if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the
holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance for unclaimed funds held by
a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment
of
any
Bond
as
described in Section 17(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section
shall be held and paid as provided
in said Section 17(a) for unclaimed
funds held by a Paying Agent.

to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for

shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of

Bond
Anticipation

purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a
facsimile.
Such
Notes
shall
express upon their face the purpose
for which they are issued and that
they are issued pursuant to this
ordinance, and may be payable in
Federal Reserve funds of the United States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Direc-

50
tor of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate

10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold
to Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc., and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (the “Note

sale shall be paid into the proper

which the Notes are being issued
under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full

are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value

shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or
any other appropriate disclosure

document “final” for purposes of
SEC Rule 15c2-12.

the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records
and make calculations and reports,
and (v) refrain from certain uses of

service on which is paid from proceeds of the Notes or the Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series

compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Notes
and the Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are

respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds.

Ord. No. 944-96.
By
Councilman
Rokakis
(by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to amend
sections 179.01, 179.03, 179.04, 179.09
and 179.11 of the codified ordinances
of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by Ordinance No. 1748-80, passed
October 8, 1980, to amend Section
179.10, of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended
by Ordinance No. 1398-83, passed
may 16, 1983, to amend Section
179.12 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended
by Ordinance No. 1111-83, passed
May 6, 1983, and to amend sections
1, 6, 9, and 17 of Ordinance No. 174980, passed October 8, 1980, all relating to the City’s covenants under its

The City Record
general bond ordinance; appointing
a successor trustee under the general bond ordinance; and authorizing and approving related matters.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 1748-80, passed by the Council of
the City of Cleveland on October 8,
1980, as amended by Ordinance No.
1111-83, passed May 6, 1983, and
Ordinance No. 1398-83, passed May
16, 1983, the City amended Sections
179.01 through 179.18 of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
to provide that the City escrow its
bond retirement fund (the “Sinking
Fund”) with the Escrow Agent
(defined therein) to help restore the
confidence of investors in the creditworthiness of the City, to establish
a Reserve Account (as defined
therein), to require that it be maintained at an amount equal to fifteen
percent of the highest aggregate
annual debt charges on all City
voted and unvoted general obligation bonds and notes payable in any
subsequent year, and to provide that
moneys held therein shall be used
for the payment of debt charges to
the extent that moneys available in
other accounts in the Sinking Fund
are insufficient for such purposes;
and
Whereas, the City’s financial management
and
practices
have
improved and the confidence of
investors in the creditworthiness of
the City has been restored to the
extent that the maintenance and
funding of the Reserve Account in
the Sinking Fund is no longer necessary to enable the City to issue
general obligation debt under favorable terms to the City; and
Whereas, it is therefore desirable
to amend various sections of Chapter 179 of the Codified Ordinances
of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, to eliminate the Reserve Account in the
Sinking Fund and the requirement
that the Reserve Account be funded; and
Whereas, the City covenanted in
Ordinance No. 1749-80, passed October 8, 1980, as amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83, passed May 6,
1983 (the “General Bond Ordinance”)
to maintain the moneys and investments in the Sinking Fund in trust
with the Escrow Agent and to provide for deposits to the accounts in
the Sinking Fund; and
Whereas, Section 14 of the General Bond Ordinance provides that the
City and the Trustee (as defined
therein)
may
execute
amending
ordinances amending the General
Bond Ordinance, subject in the case
of
certain
amendments
to
the
receipt of the consent of not less
than 66-2/3% of the holders of outstanding general obligation bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance; and
Whereas, the original purchasers
of the City’s outstanding general
obligation bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance in 1993 and
1994, as a condition of their purchase of those bonds and on behalf
of all subsequent holders of those
bonds, consented to the amendments
contained herein to eliminate the
Reserve Account and the requirement that the Reserve Account be
funded and maintained, the City
intends to obtain the consent to
those amendments from the original
purchasers of the City’s general
obligation bonds to be issued under
the General Bond Ordinance in 1996
and, upon receipt of the consents of
those 1996 bondholders, the consents
of the holders of not less than 662/3% of outstanding general oblig-

949

51
ation bonds issued under the General Bond Ordinance will have been
obtained; and
Whereas,
it
is
necessary
to
appoint a successor trustee under
the General Bond Ordinance to
replace Society National Bank (the
successor to Morgan Guaranty Trust
Company of New York, the original
trustee) because Society National
Bank has sold substantially all of
its corporate trust operations, and it
is necessary and desirable to make
certain amendments to the General
Bond Ordinance that do not require
the consent of bondholders to cure
certain inconsistencies in the General Bond Ordinance resulting from
the change in the bank serving as
Trustee and paying agent; and
Whereas, it is necessary that this
Ordinance become effective immediately in order that the City may
promptly proceed in 1996 with the
issuance of bonds under the General Bond Ordinance and proceed to
implement the amendments to effect
the elimination of the Reserve
Account in order to achieve more
efficiency in its financial management, and as a result, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety, and for
the usual, daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland that:
Section 1. Amendment. The following Sections of Chapter 179 of

May 16, 1983, and Section 179.12, as

Section 9. Supplementary Debt Service Moneys.
(a) Covenant. Subject to the provisions of subsection (g) hereof, the

as any of the Bonds are outstanding, it will collect, appropriate and

Sinking Fund held by the Escrow
Agent, for the payment of debt
charges payable from such account,
municipal income taxes and other
taxes, receipts, and available revenues sufficient in amount and time

amount of municipal income taxes
shall be determined annually and
adjusted periodically as follows:
With each tax budget, the City shall
set forth a schedule, on a monthly
basis for the full budget year, of the
year-end balances and the tax and

tax, and the times and amounts of
payments
from
the
respective
accounts of the Sinking Fund to
meet the required debt charges

May 22, 1996
payable from such accounts. For
such tax budget purpose, such tax
and other receipts planned to be
credited to the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account shall be
limited to the ad valorem tax levy
within the ten-mill limitation, special assessments levied for debt
charges on unvoted general obligations, accrued interest and premium,
if any, received upon the sale of
unvoted general obligations, reasonably estimated interest income properly to be credited to the Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations Account,
including interest from investment
of moneys held to the credit of such
account. To the extent of any deficiency in time or amount of such
revenue receipts to be credited to
the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the Sinking Fund
to meet debt charges payable from
such account there shall be set forth
in such schedule of monthly payments from the income tax receipts,
in equal monthly amounts from the
first month of the year, sufficient to
meet such deficiency, to wit: As to
the first debt charges payment date
for which a deficiency is determined
(by
taking
into
account
only
receipts to be credited to such
account from the above-described
sources, other than the income
taxes, through the last calendar
month preceding such debt charges
payment date), the schedule shall
provide for payments from the
income tax receipts to such account
in each month from the first month
of the year to the month preceding
that
in
which
such
first
debt
charges payment date occurs, inclusive, of monthly amounts equal to
such deficiency divided by the number of such months of the year preceding the month in which such
debt charges payment date occurs;
for each subsequent debt charges
payment date any such deficiency
shall be determined on the basis of
such other receipts to be credited to
the account through the last full
calendar month preceding such date
after
deducting
debt
charges
payable from the account prior to
such date, and the schedule shall
provide for payments from the
income tax receipts to such account
in each month from the first month
of the year to the month preceding
that in which such debt charges
payment date occurs, inclusive, in
monthly amounts equal to such deficiency divided by the number of
such months of the year preceding
the month in which such debt
charges payment date occurs; so
that the total amount so scheduled
to be deposited to such account from
income tax receipts in any month
shall be the aggregate of the respective equal monthly amounts determined with respect to each such
debt service payment date. Such
schedule, certified by the Director of
Finance of the City, shall be delivered by the City to the Trustee a
reasonable time before the tax budget is adopted by the City. Such
schedule
and
certification
and
revised schedules certified under
this paragraph shall be accompanied by a report prepared by the
independent
accounting
firm
engaged pursuant to paragraph (c)
of Section 10 of this Ordinance stating, and showing financial data sufficient to demonstrate, that the total
amount to be deposited to the Unvoted
Tax
Supported
Obligations
Account from income tax receipts in
any month as set forth in such
schedule is consistent with the

The City Record
requirements of paragraph (b) of
this Section, and that the making of
such deposits can reasonably be
expected to result in there being
amounts in the Account sufficient to
make timely payment of all debt
charges scheduled to be paid from
such Account during such budget
year. The City shall provide to the
Trustee all information required by
the Trustee with respect to such
schedule or revised schedule, including designation of the amounts from
specified sources to be deposited to
the credit of the respective accounts
of the Sinking Fund. The City shall
also cause a certified copy of the
schedule to be submitted to the Central Collection Agency (Income Tax
Administrator of the City) or other
entity or officer having charge of
collection of the City’s income taxes
at the time (the “Agency”, which
term, where appropriate, includes
the
Central
Collection
General
Account, or any other fund or
account in or to the credit of which
income tax receipts allocable to the
City are first held upon collection
and prior to distribution to other
funds or accounts of the City; and
also includes any agency which is
independent of the City hereafter
authorized to collect the City’s
income taxes, for which purpose the
City hereby covenants that in so
authorizing such collection by such
agency the City shall require the
agreement of such agency, for the
benefit of the Bondholders, to comply with the applicable provisions of
this Ordinance pertaining to the
Agency). The tax budget of the City
and its appropriation ordinances
shall be consistent with such certified schedule. The City shall monitor continuously all estimates and
actual receipts of the amounts from
the respective sources to be deposited to the respective accounts of the
Sinking Fund. If at any time the
projected or actual amount of the
receipts in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account from
sources other than income taxes is
less than the amount budgeted from
such
sources
or
the
projected
amount required to be paid from
such account will be greater than
estimated in such schedule, the
Director of Finance shall certify a
revised
schedule
of
increased
deposits from the income tax, based
on a projection of the same proportional deficiency from such other
sources for the ensuing months of
the fiscal year or such greater deficiency from such sources as the circumstances indicate to the Director
of Finance and projection of such
revised requirements, such that the
increased deposits from the income
tax will be sufficient to meet such
projected deficiencies and requirements. The Director of Finance
shall certify such revised schedule
of deposits from the income tax to
the Trustee and to the Agency. If
the deposits from said sources other
than from the income tax shall for
at least three consecutive months
thereafter
achieve
the
budgeted
amount and amounts of any additional requirements not anticipated
in the budget, the Director of
Finance may again revise the schedule for deposits of income taxes consistent with the original schedule
and similarly certify to the Trustee
(with supporting information) and
to the Agency. At any time that
deposits to the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account from
sources other than the income tax
have exceeded the amounts sched-

953

55
uled therefrom for three consecutive
months, the Director of Finance
may certify a revised schedule of
deposits thereto from the income
tax to the Trustee and to the
Agency. Such schedule may also be
revised at any time, in a manner
consistent with the objective of this
section, upon the concurrence of the
Director of Finance and the Trustee
and certification of the revised
schedule by the Director of Finance
to the Trustee and to the Agency.
(c) Withholding and Payment.
Commencing with the first day of
each month during which a deposit
from the income tax receipts is to
be made to the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund in accordance with
the schedule last certified by the
Director of Finance to the Trustee
and to the Agency (the “Effective
Schedule”), there shall be withheld
in the Agency, from the first and
ensuing collections of income taxes
allocable to the City the full amount
to be so deposited in such month
and there shall not be paid over
from the Agency to any other City
fund any amount from income tax
receipts allocable to the City until
the amounts of income tax receipts
set forth in the Effective Schedule
for that month has been reserved
and paid over directly from the
Agency to the Escrow Agent and
receipt thereof has been acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. Such
amount shall be paid over to the
Escrow Agent in the most expeditious manner practical as may be
arranged among the Director of
Finance,
the
Agency
and
the
Escrow Agent. In any event, those
officers of the City having the
authority to act in the matter (currently,
the
Commissioner
of
Accounts, Treasurer and Income
Tax Administrator of the City) shall
take all such actions as are necessary or appropriate to make prompt
payments of income tax receipts
directly to the Escrow Agent as provided for in this Section.
(d) Sufficiency Assured. In any
event, if at any time the Escrow
Agent or the Trustee notifies the
Director of Finance and the Agency
that amounts held by the Escrow
Agent and projected to be deposited
to the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account will be insufficient
to meet the ensuing payments of
debt charges to be paid therefrom
and the amounts of such deficiency,
the City shall, in the manner provided in paragraph (c) of this section, promptly transfer from income
tax receipts allocable to the City
then held by the Agency, and from
the first such receipts following
such certification, to the Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations Account,
the amounts of such deficiency
before making any further distribution therefrom to the City.
(e) Pledge and Covenant to Maintain Income Tax. So long as the
Bonds are outstanding, the City
hereby
pledges
the
municipal
income taxes of the City and grants
a first lien thereon, to the full
extent
required
to
meet
debt
charges payable from the Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations Account
in accordance with this Ordinance
and Chapter 179, to secure the payment of the debt charges on the
Bonds,
on
a
parity
with
debt
charges on all Outstanding Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations of the
City payable from such Account and
debt charges on any other Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations of the

56
City hereafter issued which are
payable from the Unvoted Tax Supported
Obligations
Account
and
which are secured by a pledge and
lien expressly stated to be granted
on a parity with that herein provided and which obligations are
issued consistent with the provisions of this Section, Sections 2, 3
and 5, and paragraphs (g), (h), (j)
and (m) of Section 10 hereof. The
City covenants to appropriate annually sufficient amounts from the
income taxes for such purpose. The
City further covenants that so long
as any of the Bonds are outstanding, the City shall not repeal or
amend any ordinance for the levy or
collection of its income taxes in any
manner or to such extent that the
City would not be able to meet its
obligations to the holders of the
Bonds under this Section, and any
attempt to do so in any manner
shall be void and of no effect.
(f) Appropriations; Superseding
Effect. The City further covenants
that all income taxes and other
taxes, receipts, and available revenues to be deposited with the
Escrow Agent to the credit of the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund in
accordance
with
this
Ordinance
shall be deemed to be appropriated
to such accounts and shall not be
available for or appropriated to any
other purpose, and that any appropriation ordinance or transfer ordinance or order inconsistent with
this covenant shall not be or be
deemed to be effective to authorize
application of such income tax revenues to other purposes to the
extent inconsistent herewith. Each
officer of the City having authority
to make contracts or expenditures is
hereby directed to give full effect to
this covenant of the City, and the
Director of Finance is hereby directed not to, and shall not, certify
availability of funds for any other
purpose
inconsistent
with
this
covenant. In order to avoid violation
of this covenant, the City further
hereby covenants to adopt and
promptly to amend its appropriation
ordinances to such extent as may be
proper
to
reflect
the
Effective
Schedule under (b) of this section
and the latest certifications of the
Escrow Agent or Trustee under
paragraph (e) of this section. The
provisions of this section shall prevail over and supersede any ordinance or codified ordinance of the
City heretofore or hereafter adopted
to any extent that such ordinance is
inconsistent with this section.
(g) The amount of municipal
income taxes required to be collected,
appropriated,
deposited,
and
pledged and as to which a first lien
is granted pursuant to this Section
9 shall not exceed Two Million Five
Hundred
Thousand
Dollars
($2,500,000) in any year, reduced in
any year after 1983 by the amount
by which the shortfall in such subsequent year is less than the shortfall in 1983 (the “Ceiling”); provided, however, that:
(i) If, after the issuance of all the
Bonds pursuant to the Agreement,
the
City,
subject
to
Council
approval, issues additional unvoted
general obligation bonds or notes in
anticipation of such bonds, or if any
amount of debt charges on Self-Supporting Obligations of the City

payable from the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund pursuant to Chapter
179, and if, after such issuance or
such debt charges become payable
from said Account, such amount of
municipal income taxes, as determined in accordance with subsections (b) and (e) hereof, exceeds
the ceiling, then such amount of
municipal income taxes to be collected, appropriated, deposited and
pledged pursuant to this Section 9
shall be the amount so determined;
(ii) If, while the ceiling is in
effect, the amount of such municipal income taxes, as determined in
accordance with subsections (b) and

the City shall set forth in the schedule required under Subsection 9(b)
hereof the source and amount of
other additional available revenues
(subject to application of local government fund receipts to make
deposits for the payment of debt
charges on notes hereafter issued
under Section 118.17 of the Revised
Code of Ohio) to be credited and
deposited to the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account in addition to the tax and other receipts,
including an amount of municipal
income tax receipts not less than
the ceiling, otherwise to be credited
to that account under Subsection
9(b) hereof, and such other additional available revenues shall be
included in determining the sufficiency of the total amount to be
credited to said Account, and, as the
case may be, the City shall likewise
make deposits from such available
revenues at the times and in the
amounts to satisfy subsection (e) of
this Section 9;
(iii) Nothing in this subsection
(g) shall be deemed to prohibit the
City, in its discretion, from appropriating
and
depositing
to
the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account any additional amount of
municipal income taxes.
For purposes of this Subsection
(g), the amount by which the shortfall in any subsequent year is less
than the shortfall in 1983 shall be
determined by calculating the difference
between
the
remainder
(whether negative or positive) in
1983 and in such subsequent year
after subtracting the debt charges
on all Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations from the proceeds of the
unvoted ad valorem property taxes
levied for such debt charges in the
applicable year, based upon budget
estimates to be subsequently adjusted to actual figures.

priate Sinking Fund accounts to the

payment of Bond service charges on
the Bonds.
(a) Nonpresentment of Bonds or
Coupons. In the event any Bond
shall not be presented for payment
when the principal thereof becomes
due, either at maturity, at the date
fixed for redemption thereof, or otherwise, or in the event any coupon
shall not be presented for payment
at the due date thereof. If funds sufficient to pay such Bond or coupon
shall have been made available to
the Paying Agents for the benefit
of the holder or holders thereof, all
liability of the City to the holder
thereof for the payment of such
Bond or coupon, as the case may be,
shall thereupon cease and be completely discharged, and it shall be
the duty of the Paying Agents to
hold such funds, without liability
for interest thereon, in a separate
account for the benefit of the holder of such Bond, or the holder of
such coupon, as the case may be,
who shall thereafter be restricted
exclusively to such funds for any
claim of whatever nature on his
part under this Ordinance or on, or
with
respect
to,
said
Bond
or
coupon; provided that any funds
which shall be so held by the Paying
Agents
and
which
remain
unclaimed by the holder of the Bond
or coupon not presented for payment
for a period of two years after such
due date thereof, shall upon request
in writing by the City be returned
by the Paying Agent to the City for
credit to the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account in the Sinking Fund free of any special claim
of such holder and thereafter the
holder of such Bond or coupon shall
look only to the City for payment
without any interest thereon, and
the Paying Agents shall have no
further responsibility with respect
to such moneys.
(b) Funds to be Held in Trust. All
moneys required or permitted to be
deposited with or paid to the Paying Agents under any provision of
this Ordinance and any investments
thereof, shall be held by the Paying
Agents in trust and, except for moneys deposited with or paid to the
Paying Agents for the redemption
of Bonds, notice of the redemption
of which has been duly given, and
moneys held by the Paying Agents
pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof,
shall, while held by the Paying
Agents, be subject to the lien hereof.
(c) Appointment of Successor Paying Agent. In case a Paying Agent
shall resign or be dissolved, or otherwise become incapable of acting
hereunder, or in case it shall be
taken under the control of any public officer or officers, or of a receiver appointed by a court, a successor
shall be appointed by the City.
Every such successor Paying Agent
appointed pursuant to the provisions
of this Section shall be a corporate
trust company or bank or banking
association in good standing and
willing to accept the position under
the terms and conditions of this
Ordinance.

successor
Paying

issue of Bonds sold under the Agreement. The City shall publish notice
of the appointment of such successor Paying Agent in the manner
provided for publication of notice of

May 22, 1996
Agent, and any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, may in
good faith, become the owners of
Bonds and coupons appertaining
thereto issued pursuant to this Ordinance with the same rights which
they would have hereunder if the
Paying Agent were not such.

no longer capable of acting as
Trustee under the General Bond

By Councilman Polensek.
An emergency resolution urging
the City to develop a program
designed
to
provide
specially
trained nurses to provide assistance
to victims of rape.
Whereas, New Jersey, Massachusetts and other states are developing statewide programs in which
certain designated nurses are specially trained to examine victims of
rape; and

are
based upon the City of Tulsa’s Sexual
Assault
Nurse
Examiners
(“SANE”) program which seeks to
provide more compassionate care for
victims of rape through specially
trained nurses; and
Whereas, these nurses are trained
to respond to the victim's physical
trauma and become experienced in
evidence collection to help law
enforcement officers in locating the
rapists; and
Whereas, such programs provide
needed comfort to rape victims and
have increased the conviction rate
against their assailants;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure pro-

963

health or safety in that the victims
of rape need immediate assistance

compassion and understanding; now,
