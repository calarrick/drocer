ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 375-96.
By Councilman Melena.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor and the Administration to
plan for the utilization of clean
material from the demolition of
Cleveland
Municipal
Stadium
to
expand the Cuyahoga County Com-

1966

October 16, 1996
missioners Reef or build new reefs
in order to create the largest freshwater artificial reef system in the
world.
Whereas, since the late 1700’s the
Japanese have successfully used
artificial reef technology to create
and
enhance
coastal
fishing
grounds; and
Whereas, the Western Basin of
Lake Erie is known as the “Walleye Capital of the World” because
this area produces more walleye per
hectare than any other lake in the
world; and
Whereas, the Western Basin is
shallow and dotted with islands and
natural reefs which provide necessary habitat for many fish species
including bass, perch and walleye;
and
Whereas, the Central Basin is
deeper, larger and lacks the necessary near shore productive bottom
structures nature provided the Western Basin; and
Whereas, since the central basin
lacks the near shore structures necessary to fish habitats the Central
Basin fishing areas are not within
safe running distance for smaller
boats; and
Whereas, in the 1980’s the North
Central Ohio Sea Grant Committee
caused the creation of artificial
reefs in Lake Erie off the coast of
Lorain and Cuyahoga Counties; and
Whereas, in 1984 the Cuyahoga
County Commissioners contributed
$62,500.00 towards the artificial reef
off the Cuyahoga County Coast; and
Whereas, said artificial reef is
known as the “Cuyahoga County
Commissioner’s Reef”; and
Whereas, in 1984, the Cuyahoga
County
Commissioners
estimated
that the artificial reef off the Cuyahoga County Coast was expected to
inject over 50 million dollars into
the local economy; and
Whereas, studies of the Cuyahoga
County Commissioner’s Reef have
shown the reef to have exceeded
expectations in its impact on fishing in the Central Basin; and
Whereas, an expansion of the
existing artificial reef systems in
the Western Basin will further concentrate fish within a given area
near shore; and
Whereas, artificial reef expansion
will create permanent habitats for
many fish species by providing
food,
shelter,
protection
and
a
spawning area; and
Whereas, the expansion of near
shore permanent fish habitat will
benefit
the
Cleveland
economy
through non-local anglers’ expenditures of gas, food, bait, tackle and
overnight lodging; and
Whereas, if the proposed settlement between the NFL and the City
of Cleveland is approved, Cleveland
Municipal Stadium will be demolished and a new facility will be
built to house the Cleveland Browns
NFL franchise; and
Whereas, in order to demolish
Municipal
Stadium
lead
and
asbestos abatement of the structure
must be completed prior to demolition; and
Whereas, upon demolition of the
structure, a huge quantity of clean
brick and concrete rubble will need
to be transported off site and disposed of; and
Whereas, the brick and concrete
rubble created by the proposed
demolition of Municipal Stadium
would only need to be transported
across the street to the Port of

October 16, 1996
Cleveland and hauled to a reef site
for use in expansion of the reef system; and
Whereas, the use of the brick and
concrete rubble for expansion of the
artificial reef system will save hundreds of thousands of dollars in the
current demolition budget for the
proposed stadium; and
Whereas, the use of said concrete
and brick rubble to build artificial
reef structures will save scarce
landfill resources and create an
asset at minimal cost which will
survive
for
many
generations
beyond the proposed facility; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that plans for a
new artificial reef to benefit the
Cleveland
area
should
proceed
simultaneously with plans for the
future of Cleveland Municipal Stadium; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Mayor and the Administration to
plan for the utilization of clean
material from the demolition of
Cleveland
Municipal
Stadium
to
expand the Cuyahoga County Commissioners Reef or build new reefs
in order to create the largest freshwater artificial reef system in the
world.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to the Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted September 30, 1996.
Effective October 9, 1996.
Res. No. 1851-96.
By Councilman Johnson.

objecting to the transfer of ownership and
location of a C2 and C2X Liquor Permit to 12916 Forest Avenue, first
floor and basement.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Director of Liquor Control of an application for the transfer of ownership and location of a

12916 Forest Avenue, first floor and
basement, Cleveland, Ohio 44120;
and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health

The City Record

of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
safety and welfare pursuant to Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised

permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within 30

resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that
the hearing be held in Cleveland,
Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
