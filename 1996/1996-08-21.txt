as having “socialist” ideas, and stating that Senator Kucinich’s workers
rights platform is similar to the
Communist manifesto; and
Whereas, voters are already very
skeptical of the political process
because of all the negativity and
name calling, making it imperative
that we not have another round of
McCarthy-like political tactics; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that every effort
should be made to stick to issues
and avoid name-calling during the
upcoming election campaign; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby deplores the tactics used by
Cuyahoga County Republican Chairman James Trakas in his recent letter to party members, and strongly
urges all candidates and their supporters to conduct the 1996 election
campaign by sticking to the issues
and avoiding name calling.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to James
Trakas, Jimmy Dimora, Congressman Martin Hoke, State Senator
Dennis
Kucinich,
Congressman
Steve LaTourette and Mayor Tom
Coyne.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution opposing
the recent decision by Ameritech to
close its public bill paying office on
East Ninth Street.
Whereas, certain recent corporate
decisions by Ameritech have raised
serious doubts about Ameritech’s
corporate sensitivity to the needs of
City residents; and
Whereas, Ameritech has decided
to close its public bill paying service at its facility on East 9th
Street, where City residents can pay
their telephone bills without any
cost; and
Whereas, this decision means that
City residents must pay their bills
at other facilities which charge service fees and require copies of bills
or
detailed
account
information
prior to allowing the payment of the
bill; and
Whereas, the closing of the pub-

1584

August 21, 1996
lic bill paying service at its downtown facility will cause hardship
and increased costs to citizens who
cannot support this burden; and
Whereas, Ameritech has asked
this Council in the past to support
its corporate decisions; and
Whereas, this Council cannot continue to support Ameritech when
Ameritech so callously ignores the
needs of City residents; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that Ameritech’s
decision will create undue hardship
for
Cleveland’s
residents;
now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes the recent decision by
Ameritech to close its public bill
paying service at its facility on
East Ninth Street.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to CEO of
Ameritech.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

unit by the year 2000.

An emergency resolution deploring the tactics used by Cuyahoga

The City Record
County Republican Chairman James
Trakas in his recent letter to party
members, and strongly urging all
candidates and their supporters to
stick to issues and avoid name-calling during the 1996 election campaign.
Whereas, one of America’s most
cherished values is that of freedom
of expression; and
Whereas, one of America’s darkest episodes was the McCarthy era,
in
which
many
citizens
were
deprived of their livelihood, reputation, and well-being through a campaign of fear and red-baiting; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga Republican
Party
Chairman
James
Trakas
recently sent a letter to party members describing State Senator Dennis Kucinich and Mayor Tom Coyne
as having “socialist” ideas, and stating that Senator Kucinich’s workers
rights platform is similar to the
Communist manifesto; and
Whereas, voters are already very
skeptical of the political process
because of all the negativity and
name calling, making it imperative
that we not have another round of
McCarthy-like political tactics; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that every effort
should be made to stick to issues
and avoid name-calling during the
upcoming election campaign; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby deplores the tactics used by
Cuyahoga County Republican Chairman James Trakas in his recent letter to party members, and strongly
urges all candidates and their supporters to conduct the 1996 election
campaign by sticking to the issues
and avoiding name calling.

Trakas, Jimmy Dimora, Congressman Martin Hoke, State Senator

An emergency resolution opposing
the recent decision by Ameritech to
close its public bill paying office on
East Ninth Street.
Whereas, certain recent corporate
decisions by Ameritech have raised
serious doubts about Ameritech’s
corporate sensitivity to the needs of
City residents; and
Whereas, Ameritech has decided
to close its public bill paying service at its facility on East 9th
Street, where City residents can pay
their telephone bills without any
cost; and
Whereas, this decision means that
City residents must pay their bills

1613

55
at other facilities which charge service fees and require copies of bills
or
detailed
account
information
prior to allowing the payment of the
bill; and
Whereas, the closing of the public bill paying service at its downtown facility will cause hardship
and increased costs to citizens who
cannot support this burden; and
Whereas, Ameritech has asked
this Council in the past to support
its corporate decisions; and
Whereas, this Council cannot continue to support Ameritech when
Ameritech so callously ignores the
needs of City residents; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that Ameritech’s
decision will create undue hardship
for
Cleveland’s
residents;
now,

the City of Cleveland:

Ameritech to close its public bill
paying service at its facility on

RULES AND REGULATIONS
PURSUANT TO CHAPTER 196
OF THE CODIFIED
ORDINANCES
Tax on the Privilege of Housing,
Storing or Parking a Motor Vehicle
in or on Any Parking Facility in the
City of Cleveland
Concerning the privilege of housing, storing or parking a motor
vehicle in or on any parking facility in the City of Cleveland and subject to tax pursuant to Section 196.03
and
pursuant
to
Section
196.06
authorizing the Commissioner of
Assessments and Licenses to adopt,
promulgate and enforce rules and
regulations relating to any matter
or thing pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this
Chapter, including but not limited to
provisions relating to recordkeeping, the following rules and/or regulations are hereby promulgated by
the Commissioner of Assessments
and Licenses.
Rule 1
(a) It shall be the duty of every
operator of a parking facility within the City of Cleveland to issue to
each patron a distinctive ticket or
claim check unless one of the following conditions apply:
(i)
the
patron
has
reserved
his/her space in the parking facility for a period of more than one day
by means of a lease, contract or similar arrangement; or
(ii) the operator did not have a
ticketing system in place on the
date of enactment of this Chapter
and/or
has
another
reasonable
method of ascertaining the number
of patrons and the tax due, and has
notified the Commissioner of such
method.
(iii) If a parking facility becomes
an honor lot after the effective date
of these regulations, then the operator must comply with (ii) above.
(b) Any operator who fails to
comply with paragraph (a) herein
may be required, in connection with
an audit, to submit federal, state
and/or city income or net profits
tax returns and schedules relating
thereto. Such returns shall be kept
confidential.

1648

August 21, 1996
Rule 2
(a) Tickets or claim checks shall
be issued by an operator in numerical sequence, except that, where
practical for the operator, a numerical sequence may mean a sequence
fitting for the day, week or period
involved.
(b) When an operator conducts
business at more than one location,
separate tickets or claim checks
shall be issued for each location.
(c) In addition to the information
required by Section 196.03(e), each
operator shall report to the Commissioner the gross receipts arising
out of early bird, hourly, daily,
monthly and special-event parking
for the relavent time period and the
claim check numbers applicable to
each category. However, if the operator demonstrates to the Commissioner, a different method of reporting such gross receipts may be
acceptable to the Commissioner. If
the operator does not keep track of
early bird or hourly, for example,
and refers to those types of transactions as daily, then the operator
can report those transactions in that
manner. The operator must report
the aggregate of the receipts collected including the tax collected,
and report those receipts in the
same manner as the operator keeps
his own records.
Rule 3
It is presumed that each transaction for consideration is taxable
absent a signed certificate prescribed by the Commissioner from
the patron claiming an exemption
from the tax pursuant to Section
196.03(d). If a certificate has been
obtained from the patron, the operator shall keep such certificate on
file. Every operator who maintains
one or more exemption forms on file
for patrons shall file an exemption
form prescribed by the Commissioner annually with the operator’s January return and at such other times
as may be requested by the Commissioner.
Rule 4
Except as provided in Rule 3, it
shall be the duty of every operator
of a parking facility within the City
of Cleveland to collect the tax
levied by this Chapter from the
patron at the time the operator collects the price, charge, fee or other
consideration on which the tax is
levied. If the patron is given any
invoice, receipt or other statement
or evidence of said price, charge,
fee or other consideration paid or
payable, the tax shall be shown separately on said documents. In the
case of early bird, hourly, daily,
monthly and special-event parking,
if the ticket or claim check required
by Rule 2(b) or the invoice, receipt
or other statement or evidence does
not clearly and separately state the
amount of the tax charged and collected, then the operator shall post
signage in plain sight containing
the total parking charges and indicating that the charges include an
8% parking tax; otherwise, it shall
be presumed that the tax was not
collected and the tax shall be
assessed on the total consideration
charged for each such transaction.
Rule 5
The tax shall apply even if the
operator receives the charge, fee or
other consideration from a person
other than the patron (for example,

The City Record

August 21, 1996
when a merchant provides “complimentary” or “discounted” parking
for one or more of his/her customers, and the merchant pays the
operator a fee, charge or other consideration in lieu of the customer
paying the charge to the operator).
Rule 6
Ticket and claim check stubs
shall be retained by the operator for
a period of not less than three (3)
months subsequent to the date of filing the return reporting the transaction. All other books and records
shall be retained by the operator for
a period of not less than three (3)
years subsequent to the date of filing the return reporting the transaction.

Rule 7
Operators may report on a form
that is a reasonable facsimile of the
Commissioner’s form if all information required on the Commissioner’s
form is included in the reasonable
facsimile form. Such reasonable facsimile form shall be approved by
the Commissioner prior to its use.
Rule 8
All such parking tax returns submitted to the Commissioner, shall be
held confidential and no information
from such returns shall be released,
or shared in any manner with any
person or entity, except a lawful
agent of the United States Internal
Revenue
Service
upon
proper
demand, by an order from a court
of competent jurisdiction, or in con-

91
nection with the performance of the
official business of the Commissioner of the Division of Assessments
and Licenses of the City of Cleveland.
