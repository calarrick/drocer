meanings. “Primary signs” are a
parking facility’s principal signs
identifying
the
parking
facility
and/or its rates. A primary sign

supplementing that provided on the
primary signs, shall also be considered secondary signs.
(5) Size, Number and Height of
Signs. Each parking facility shall
be permitted a total of thirty-two
(32) square feet of “primary sign”
area for each vehicular entrance,
except that two vehicular entrances
located less than thirty (30) feet

primary sign area permitted for
each entrance may be displayed on
either one or two sign structures. If
two sign structures are used, rate
information must be readable at
each vehicular entrance. No single
primary sign shall exceed thirty-two
(32) square feet in area nor shall it

Parking Facilities. In addition to
other applicable regulations of this
section, the following supplemental
regulations shall apply to signs for
parking facilities which are available to the general public on a
hourly, daily or special event basis

facilities which are restricted to use
by employees, residents, faculty or
students of businesses, institutions
or other buildings served by the

maintaining a minimum vertical
clearance of eight (8) feet. No other
element of such sign may project

items, etc.
(3) Approval Process. The Director of the City Planning Commission
shall determine whether a proposed
sign for a visitor-oriented parking
facility meets the requirements of
this section and the adopted design
standards, and shall approve or disapprove each application on that
basis. In the case of a proposed sign
which does not meet the requirements of this section, the City Planning Commission may approve the
sign if it determines that such sign
meets the standards of division
(e)(7) of this section.
(4) Comprehensive Sign Systems
for Large-Scale Facilities. In the
case of a large-scale complex of
facilities served by a network of
parking lots or garages under common management, the City Planning
Commission
may
approve
signs
which differ from the standards
established in this section as necessary to create a uniform series of
signs which identify parking facilities serving such complex.

of a building and is better suited to
the design of such building than a
conforming sign would be, or
B. the sign meets a higher standard of design quality than would
result from minimal conformance to
the standards of this section, or

of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the

By Councilman Johnson.
An emergency resolution supporting House Bill 385 to raise the age
limit for consentual sexual relations
from 13 years to 17 years, and urging the House to amend the law to
include mandatory life in prison
sentencing with no possibility for
parole for anyone convicted of raping a child under 17 years of age.
Whereas, under current law, in
place since the mid-1970s, “statutory
rape” can be charged only if one
participant is under age 13; and
Whereas, under current law, the
offense for engaging in consentual
sexual
relations
with
a
child
between 13 years of age and 17 is
“corruption of a minor”; and
Whereas, incidences of teenage
pregnancies have skyrocketed since
the mid-1970s when the age limit for
sexual consent was set at 13; and
Whereas, a high percentage of the
babies born to teenagers today are
being fathered by men over 21 years
of age; and
Whereas, the House recently took
issue with teenage pregnancies by
amending House Bill 385 to raise
the age of sexual consent from 13
to age 17; and
Whereas,
Ohio
taxpayers
are
forced to bear some of the costs of
the $2.4 billion in Ohio child-support
arrearages; and
Whereas, under current law rape
is an aggravated felony of the first
degree, punishable by up to 25 years
in prison and a fine of up to $10,000;
and
Whereas, if an underage victim is
compelled by force or the threat of

The City Record
force, the penalty is life in prison;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health, safety or welfare of Ohio’s
youth; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the amendment to House Bill
385 to raise the age limit for consentual sexual relations from 13
years to 17 years.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the House to amend House Bill 385
to include mandatory life in prison
sentencing with no possibility for
parole for anyone convicted of raping a child under 17 years of age if
the underage victim is compelled by
force or the threat of force.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
