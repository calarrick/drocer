An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of the Office of
Equal
Opportunity
to
increase
employment utilization goals for
minorities and females on public
works construction projects taking
place within the boundaries of the
City of Cleveland.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Legislative Findings.
The Employment Affirmative Action
and Training Committee of this
Council has conducted an investigation of employment equity in the
City of Cleveland for minorities and
females. Based upon the emperical
data derived in support of its study
and the testimony, interviews and
surveys obtained at committee hearings, the Committee finds that there
is evidence of continued discrimination
in
the
construction
trades
industry
against
minorities
and
females. In addition, the Committee
makes the following findings:
1. The present federal employment
utilization goals of 16.1% for minorities and 6.9% for females that have
been used as a benchmark for
employment
representation
since
1972 are outdated and need to be
changed;
2. Upon examining nine major
construction projects taking place
in the City of Cleveland, minority
representation ranged from 13% to
36%, with a significant number of
these sites utilizing percentages of
22% and higher;
3. The female employment uti-

February 14, 1996
lization goal of 6.9% is rarely met
on a majority of these construction
projects;
4. Minorities comprise 53% of the
population of the City of Cleveland,
28% of Cuyahoga County and 18%
of the Cleveland PMSA and females
comprise more than one-half of the
population of the City and County
in the PMSA area and in minority
communities females head up more
than one-half of all households. Yet,
minorities and females continue to
have high unemployment rates and
suffer from low access to the construction trades;
5. Minority and female representation in apprenticeship training
programs throughout the Cleveland
PMSA is below the federal goals of
16.1% for minorities, and 6.9% for
females;
6. According to data received from
the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, minority and female
membership composition in the local
building trade unions in the Cleveland PMSA is below the federal
goals.
Section 2. That the Director of the
Office of Equal Opportunity is hereby
authorized
and
directed
to
increase
employment
utilization
goals for minorities and females on
public work construction projects
taking place in the City of Cleveland consistent with the provisions
of this ordinance. For any construction contract advertised after the
effective date of this ordinance and
having
an
estimated
value
of
$100,000 or more, and which is funded entirely by the City of Cleveland
or in part with federal grant opportunities for the poor, minorities
and/or unemployed including, without limitation, Community Development Block Grants, Urban Development Action Grants and Economic
Development Administration Grants,
minorities shall perform between
22% and 30% of the the total construction worker hours performed
by the contractor and subcontractors in the category of unskilled
construction laborers, and females
shall perform between 6.9% and
10% of such work. In addition,
minorities shall perform between
22% and 30% of the the total construction worker hours performed
by the contractor and subcontractors in the category of skilled construction
trade
workers,
and
females shall perform between 6.9%
and 10% of such work. These percentage levels are intended as minimum goals for minority and female
representation as unskilled laborers
and skilled trade workers on the
construction project and shall not be
construed as limiting or deferring
the full utilization of minorities and
females beyond these numerical levels.
Section 3. As used in Section 2 of
this ordinance, “skilled construction
trades workers” includes all worksite
foreman,
journeyworkers,
including
technical
engineers,
apprentices, construction trainees
and elevator construction helpers,
and apprentices that are in a bona
fide apprenticeship training program that is certified by the U.S.
Department of Labor Bureau of
Apprenticeship
and
Training.
Salaried superintendents are excluded from the coverage of this special
provision, as well as other helpers,
watchmen, clerical workers, security guards, and custodial workers.
Section 4. In order to verify compliance with this ordinance, a contractor shall provide for the main-

The City Record
tenance
of
adequate
employee
records to ensure that minorities,
and females are employed on the
project. The contractor and each
subcontractor shall maintain copies
of personal documents supportive of
minority and female hiring, and
employment. Weekly certified payroll reports shall be submitted to
the Director of the Office of Equal
Opportunity in triplicate and shall
identify clearly the race and gender
of every employee on each submitted certified payroll. The first time
that an employees name appears on
a payroll, the date that the company hired the employee should be
written in after the employee’s
name. In the weekly payroll reports,
Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian Pacific and Asian Indian employees should be listed separately for purposes of the canvassing formula. Full access to the contractor’s and each subcontractors’
employment record must be granted
to the Purchasing Agent, the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
and the Director of the Office of
Equal Opportunity. The contractor
and subcontractors shall maintain
all
relevant
personnel
data
in
records for a period of at least three
years after final acceptance of the
work.
All
contractors
shall
be
required to follow the 16 step program in order to show that good
faith efforts are being implemented
to
reach
employment
utilization
goals of minorities and females.
Good faith efforts on the part of the
contractor to provide utilization of
minorities, and females shall not
suffice to replace the actual, verified achievement of the requirements of this section concerning the
worker hours performed by minorities, and females.
Section 5. In accordance with promoting equality of employment for
minority and female personnel on
construction projects, no employer
shall discriminate against any person on the basis of race or sex.
Whoever violates this section is
guilty of a first degree misdemeanor.
Section 6. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Councilman Willis.
An ordinance to supplement the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, by enacting new Section
629.11 thereof, relating to the retail
sale for off premises consumption of
soft drinks and nonalcoholic beverages in chilled glass bottles.
Whereas, the retail sale of certain
soft drinks and nonalcoholic beverages in breakable glass containers
which are improperly disposed of
when empty has resulted in such a
proliferation of broken glass in and
upon the streets, parks and other
public grounds of the City as to render said public grounds dangerous

207

11
to our citizens and particularly to
our children; and
Whereas, the problem of broken
glass caused by improper disposal
of empty softdrink bottles poses a
serious health and safety problem;
and
Whereas, it is virtually impossible
to recycle glass once it is broken
and it is virtually impossible to
remove
all
broken
glass
from
grassy areas in parks and recreational areas; and
Whereas, a substantial cause of
the problem of broken glass littering streets, sidewalks, parks and
other public areas of the City is the
improper disposal of empty bottles
of soft drinks and nonalcoholic beverages which are sold chilled at
retail for off-premises consumption;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 629.11 thereof, to read
as follows:
Section 629.11 Soft Drinks in
Chilled Glass Bottles Prohibited
(a) For purposes of this section:
(1) “Soft drink” shall mean any
nonalcoholic
flavored
carbonated
beverage, soda, soda water, fruitade,
any nonalcoholic flavored still beverage, including without limitation
fruit juice, artificial waters whether
carbonated or not, and bottled table
waters, seltzer and club soda.
(2) “Chilled” means any temperature below 65° F.
(b) No person shall sell at retail
for off premises consumption any
soft drink in chilled glass bottles
unless packaged in containers of
twelve (12) bottles or more.
(c) Whoever violates this section
shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor. In addition to any other
method of enforcement provided for
in this chapter, the above listed
minor
misdemeanor
may
be
enforced by the issuance of a citation in compliance with Rule 4.1 of
the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure.
Section 2. That this ordinance
shall take effect and be in force and
after the earliest period allowed by
law.
