Jay Westbrook, President
Cleveland City Council
Room 220, City Hall
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Dear Jay,
I will be assuming my duties as
Judge of Municipal Housing Court
on January 1, 1996, 12:00 Noon, and
wish to offer my resignation as of
that date and time. My election to
that post was made possible mainly
through the efforts of the Council
and particularly you. I appreciate
the support you have given me, not
only for this election, but as your
Council Presidency and your friendship over the years.
Due to my resignation, I would
like to offer the name of Timothy
J. Melena as my successor. Tim
Melena, Ibelieve, is a good choice
that will be accepted by you and the
Democratic caucus of the Council.
Tim currently is Assistant Director of Law for the City of Cleveland
and has held that position from 1991
through the present. As a member
of the Municipal Law Section, he
has advised City Council and the
Administration on all aspects of legislative process. He has researched
and
drafted
legislation
for
the
Council and Administration and has
served as legal counsel to a number
of City Council Committees. He has
also been legal counsel to the Public Service Department. Many of my
colleagues know him for his coordination of the liquor prosecution. He
has personally prosecuted over 300
liquor objections on behalf of the
Council and has drafted 200 pieces
of legislation for the City Council.
He has also supervised and trained
other Assistant Directors of Law in
liquor prosecution. He has maintained a regular docket of tort litigation and has served as lead counsel for the City of Cleveland. He has
represented the Civil Service Com-

January 10, 1996
mission on residency requirements
and has also been involved in labor
litigation.
As you can see, Tim has the ideal
qualifications to be a legislator.
As members of the Council, we
know that being a legislator often
is not enough. Tim has worked
within his own community and is
familiar with neighborhood issues
to perform the important ombudsman role for the residents of the
17th Ward to City Hall. Tim has
organized a block club on his street,
West Clinton; has helped initiate
the Morning 5 a.m. C.B. Patrol; is a
Trustee of the Detroit Shoreway
Community Development Organization and a member of Our Lady of
Mt. Carmel Church.
Tim
has
the
competency,
demeanor and integrity to serve as
the Councilman of the 17th Ward,
and I ask for your support for his
appointment.

The City Record
na received 18 votes. Those who
voted for Mr. Melena were: Councilmen Britt, Coats, Jackson, Lewis,
McGuirk, Miller, O’Malley, Patmon,
Patton, Paulenske, Polensek, Robinson, Rokakis, Rybka, Smith, Turner,
Westbrook, Willis.
The Chair declared Mr. Timothy J.
Melena, having received the unanimous vote of all the members elected to Council to be the duly elected
Councilman of Ward 17. The President of Council requested Councilwoman Fannie M. Lewis and Councilman James Rokakis and Mr. Donald R. Melena to escort the duly
elected member of Council to the
podium to have the oath of office
administered by his father, Mr. Donald R. Melena.

By Councilman Paulenske.
An emergency resolution opposing
the decision of Leece Neville, a subsidiary of Prestolite Inc., to close its
plant at 3831 Kelly Avenue and urging its corporate officers to reconsider their decision and to work
with the Department of Economic
Development to remain in the City
of Cleveland.
Whereas, Leece Neville, a subsidiary
of
Prestolite
Inc.,
has
announced that it is closing its
plant at 3831 Kelly Avenue and relocating its operation to Arcade, New
York; and
Whereas,
after
Prestolite
Inc.
filed for bankruptcy in 1990, the
City, in a cooperative effort with
Senator Metzenbaum, Congressman
Stokes and the State of Ohio, developed a plan to preserve the financial integrity of the company within the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this plan included expediting payments to Prestolite from
its existing contracts with the U.S.
Department of Defense; 60% tax
abatement for 10 years on improvements to its facility and increased
inventory and $150,000 low interest

January 10, 1996
financing from the City; and $1.25
million low interest financing from
the State of Ohio, and
Whereas, in 1993, Prestolite decided not to accept any of these
approved public subsidies; and
Whereas, Prestolite’s decision to
relocate its plant does not make
sense in light of the obvious efforts
of the City to assist the company in
maintaining its plant on Kelly
Avenue; and
Whereas,
this
Council
urges
Prestolite to reconsider its decision
and to meet with representatives of
the Department of Economic Development to discuss financial opportunities available to Prestolite if it
remains in the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health, or safety in that all necessary steps must be taken to urge
Prestolite to reconsider its corporate
decision; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the decision of Leece Neville, a
subsidiary of Prestolite Inc., to close
its plant at 3831 Kelly Avenue and
urges its corporate officers to reconsider their decision and to work
with representatives of the Department of Economic Development to
keep its business operation within
the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the corporate officers of Leece Neville and
Prestolite Inc.

An emergency resolution objecting to the issuance of a C1 Liquor

Whereas, Council has been notified by the Director of Liquor Control

for
the
issuance of a C1 Liquor Permit to
Permit No. 5173055, James Emmett
Lewis, dba Lewis Food Market,
17502 St. Clair Avenue, Cleveland,
Ohio 44110; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
safety and welfare pursuant to Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said permit must be received by the Director of Liquor Control within 30 days
of notification; now, therefore,

Res. No. 49-96.
By Councilman Polensek.
An emergency resolution urging
the Administration to develop and
implement a program to educate the
public concerning prevention of carbon monoxide poisoning and urging
the Department of Public Safety to
investigate the feasibility of instituting a carbon monoxide detector
program to provide detectors to residents that cannot afford them.
Whereas, the recent deaths in the
Cleveland area caused by carbon
monoxide poisoning has raised the
public’s
awareness
and
concern
about this silent killer; and
Whereas, the age of Cleveland’s
housing stock and the heating systems within residences, when combined with efforts by many citizens
to better insulate their homes, has
significantly increased the risk of
carbon monoxide poisoning; and
Whereas, while the public is concerned, the public needs to be educated about the causes of carbon
monoxide in the home and the ways
to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning; and
Whereas,
the
use
of
carbon
monoxide detectors is one way to
alert residents when carbon monoxide has reached unsafe levels within a home and, thus, save lives; and
Whereas,
the
cost
of
carbon
monoxide detectors will prevent
many
Cleveland
residents
from
acquiring and using this important
safety device; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
should develop and implement an
education program concerning carbon monoxide poisoning, including
distribution of pamphlets explaining
the risks and remedies; and
Whereas, the Department of Public Safety should investigate the
feasibility of implementing a carbon
monoxide detector program similar
to the smoke detector program
implemented by the Fire Department in 1993; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health, or safety in that the City
should quickly take action to protect its citizens from the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Directors of Public Health and
Public Safety and the Commissioner
of Building and Housing to develop

18
and implement a program to educate the citizens of Cleveland concerning the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning and the ways to combat this silent killer.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the Department of Public Safety to
investigate the feasibility of implementing a program to provide carbon monoxide detectors free of
charge to residents of the City of
Cleveland that are unable to afford
them.
Section 3. That the Administration
is further urged to solicit gifts and
grants from the business community in Cleveland to assist in the
implementation of these programs.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

BOARD OF CONTROL
January 3, 1996
The regular meeting of the Board
of Control convened in the Mayor’s
office on Wednesday, January 3,
1996, at 10:30 a.m., with Mayor
White presiding.
Present: Mayor White, Directors
Sobol Jordan, Hyer, Konicek, Cunningham, Guzman, Staib, Denihan,
Spellman, Hamilton, Nolan, Warren,
Axelrod.
Absent: None.
Others: William Moon, Commissioner,
Purchases
and
Supplies,
Linda Willis, Director, Office of
Equal Opportunity.
On motion, the following resolutions were adopted.
Resolution No. 1-96.
By Director Konicek.
Whereas, pursuant to the authority of Ordinance No. 891-93, passed by
the Council of the City of Cleveland
on June 7, 1993, and Board of Control Resolution No. 979-93, adopted
November 10, 1993, the City through
its
Director
of
Public
Utilities
entered into City Contract No. 46781
with General Elevator Company,
Inc. for service and maintenance of
three (3) Dover Computamatic elevators, for a period of three (3)
years, for the Division of Water,
Department of Public Utilities; and
Whereas, pursuant to the authority of Ordinance Nos. 1254-92 and
2029-92, passed by the Council of the
City of Cleveland on June 15, 1992
and December 14, 1992, respectively,
and Board of Control Resolution No.
599-95, adopted July 9, 1995, the City
through its Director of Public Utilities entered into City Contract No.
48878 with Montgomery Kone, Inc.
for renovation of the three (3)
Dover elevators located in the building, and maintained by General Elevator under Contract No. 46781; and
Whereas,
because
Montgomery
Kone, Inc. will be maintaining the
elevators during the renovations
and for the one (1) year warranty
period thereafter, a separate additional contract for maintenance of
said elevators would be unnecessary
and
would
create
service
and
responsibility problems; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Board of
Control of the City of Cleveland that
for the foregoing reasons this Board
hereby determines that it is in the
public interest to cancel Contract
No. 46781 with General Elevator
Company, Inc., pursuant to Section
D-10 of the General Conditions of
that contract.
Yeas:
Mayor
