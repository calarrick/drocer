An emergency resolution
urging President Clinton and HUD to
stop promoting policies that will
result in the reduction of public
housing and project base housing
opportunities for low income people.
Whereas, the need for safe, sanitary, and decent housing for lowincome people has increased; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga Metropolitan
Housing Authority (“CMHA”) has
9,700 families on its waiting list;
and
Whereas, CMHA’s 9,700 family
waiting list was created from an
application
period
beginning
in
April, 1996; and
Whereas,
the
average
annual
income of a CMHA resident is just
over $5,000 dollars; and
Whereas, President Clinton and
HUD has used CMHA as a model for
how public housing should be run
throughout the country; and
Whereas,
the
United
States
Department of Housing and Urban
Development (“HUD”) has, for political reasons, reduced the housing
opportunities for low income people;
and
Whereas, HUD has encouraged
and required the demolition of public housing as a condition for receiving renovation money; and
Whereas, the most recent HUD
policy would promote private ownership of public housing by the year
2000 thus further reducing housing
opportunities for low income people;
and
Whereas, HUD promotes giving
Section 8 vouchers for public housing and project-based residents; and
Whereas, the Section 8 vouchers

August 28, 1996
are renewed annually and may not
be renewed in the drive to balance
the federal budget; and
Whereas, the neighborhoods of
greater Cleveland are unable and/or
unwilling to absorb thousands of
public housing and project-based
residents; and
Whereas, the ultimate result of
HUD’s policies is the creation of
new ghettos with substandard housing for the poor and homelessness;
now, therefore,
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that the ultimate
result of HUD’s policies is the creation of new ghettos with substandard housing for the poor and homeless; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That President Clinton
and HUD reverse their policies that
will result in reducing the number
of traditional public housing and
project-based housing opportunities
for low income people.
Section 2. That President Clinton
and HUD stop encouraging and promoting the demolition of public
housing.
Section 3. That President Clinton
and HUD stop using Section 8
vouchers as a way of displacing
low-income people from public housing and facilitating the creation of
new ghettos, substandard housing
for low-income people and homelessness.
Section 4. That President Clinton
and HUD stop the promoting of private ownership of public housing
unit by the year 2000.
Section 5. That President Clinton

income people.
Section 6. That President Clinton
and HUD provide CMHA with the
necessary funding for renovation of
public
housing,
and
traditional
replacement public housing.

An emergency resolution deploring the tactics used by Cuyahoga
County Republican Chairman James
Trakas in his recent letter to party
members, and strongly urging all
candidates and their supporters to
stick to issues and avoid name-calling during the 1996 election campaign.
Whereas, one of America’s most

The City Record
cherished values is that of freedom
of expression; and
Whereas, one of America’s darkest episodes was the McCarthy era,
in
which
many
citizens
were
deprived of their livelihood, reputation, and well-being through a campaign of fear and red-baiting; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga Republican
Party
Chairman
James
Trakas
recently sent a letter to party members describing State Senator Dennis Kucinich and Mayor Tom Coyne
as having “socialist” ideas, and stating that Senator Kucinich’s workers
rights platform is similar to the
Communist manifesto; and
Whereas, voters are already very
skeptical of the political process
because of all the negativity and
name calling, making it imperative
that we not have another round of
McCarthy-like political tactics; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that every effort
should be made to stick to issues
and avoid name-calling during the
upcoming election campaign; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby deplores the tactics used by
Cuyahoga County Republican Chairman James Trakas in his recent letter to party members, and strongly
urges all candidates and their supporters to conduct the 1996 election
campaign by sticking to the issues
and avoiding name calling.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to James
Trakas, Jimmy Dimora, Congressman Martin Hoke, State Senator
Dennis
Kucinich,
Congressman
Steve LaTourette and Mayor Tom
Coyne.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

An emergency resolution opposing
the recent decision by Ameritech to
close its public bill paying office on

Whereas, certain recent corporate
decisions by Ameritech have raised
serious doubts about Ameritech’s

Whereas, Ameritech has decided
to close its public bill paying service at its facility on East 9th
Street, where City residents can pay
their telephone bills without any
cost; and
