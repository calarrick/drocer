An ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting new Sections 511.01
through 511.12 thereof, relating to hospital trailblazer signs.
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are hereby supplemented by enacting new Section 511.01 through 511.12 thereof, to read respectively, as follows:
CHAPTER 511
HOSPITAL
TRAILBLAZER SIGNS
Section 511.01 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that signs placed in the public right-of-way to direct motorists to
emergency medical facilities are located and designed in a manner which provides information clearly and effi-

323

20

The City Record

March 6, 1996

ciently, with a minimum of confusion and clutter. Generally, these guidelines are consistent with standards established by the Ohio Department of Transportation.
Section 511.02 Definitions
(a) A “hospital trailblazer sign” is a sign located within the public right-of-way, directing the public to a qualifying hospital facility.
(b) A “standard” hospital trailblazer sign displays only the “H” symbol and a white directional arrow, as depicted in Section 511.12.
(c) A hospital trailblazer “identification” sign displays the name of each hospital to which the public is directed, as depicted in Section 511.12.
Section 511.03 Qualifying Hospital Facilities
Qualifying hospital facilities are hospitals that provide emergency medical services to the general public on a
7 day-a-week, 24 hour-a-day basis, with a physician on duty in the emergency department at all times or with a
registered nurse on duty in the emergency department and with a physician in the hospital on call. Qualifying
hospital facilities are permitted to use hospital trailblazer signs pursuant to this chapter.
Section 511.04 Design of Signs
(a) All Signs. Each hospital trailblazer sign shall consist of a rectangular metal panel 24" in width, displaying a white “H” on a blue background in a 24" square copy area, placed at the top of the sign. The sign shall
also display a directional arrow or arrows. All elements of the sign shall be displayed on a single panel, bordered in a white frame. Each sign shall be designed in accordance with the applicable illustration in Section
511.12. Each hospital may be identified with either a Standard sign or an Identification Sign, as described in
divisions (b) and (c) of this Section.
(b) Standard Signs. The Standard Sign shall be designed according to division (b) of Section 511.02. The sign
panel shall be 24" in width and a total of 33" in height, including a 9" high band for display of the directional arrow.
(c) Identification Signs. The Identification Sign shall display the name or names of each qualifying hospital
permitted to be displayed at the subject location, in accordance with the General Location Standards set forth
in Section 511.05. Each hospital name shall be displayed in white letters at least 3" in height, in a copy area
which is a maximum of 15" in height. A white directional arrow shall be placed under each hospital name. For
signs displaying the names of two or more hospitals, the hospitals shall be listed in descending order with respect
to the distance of each hospital, with the closest hospital listed first. The distance of each hospital’s emergency
entrance shall be displayed in fractions of a mile, in white numerals and letters placed to the left of the directional arrow.
Section 511.05 General Locational Standards
(a) Local Area Signs. The area within one mile of the boundaries of a qualifying hospital facility shall be
considered the “local area” for purposes of hospital trailblazer sign placement. Within the “local area,” trailblazer
signs directing motorists to the subject hospital or hospitals may be placed on arterial roads or collector roads
(as classified by the Ohio Department of Transportation) at “decision-making points” where a right or left turn
is required, and at the intersection of two or more arterial roads. Separate signs for two or more hospitals shall
not be permitted where a single, multiple-hospital sign could be placed.
(b) Signs on Freeway Routes. Outside of the 1-mile “local area,” hospital trailblazer signs shall be permitted
only on roads which provide the most direct route from freeway interchanges most directly serving a qualifying
hospital. Such signs may be placed at “decision-making points,” where a right or left turn is required for one or
more of the listed hospitals, and at the intersection of two or more arterial roads (as classified by Ohio Department of Transportation). Separate signs for two or more hospitals shall not be permitted where a single, multiple-hospital sign could be placed.
(c) Signs on Freeways. Hospital trailblazer signs shall be placed on inter-state highways and other freeways,
as well as in immediate proximity to freeway exits ramps, as permitted by the Ohio Department of Transportation.
Section 511.06 Specific Placement Standards
(a) Distance from Intersection. A permitted hospital trailblazer sign shall be placed approximately 150-200 feet
in advance of an intersection where a left turn is indicated, approximately 100 feet in advance of an intersection where only a right turn is indicated, and less than 100 feet in advance of an intersection where no turn is
indicated. Precise locations for particular signs shall be determined by the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering
and Parking.
(b) Attachment. Hospital trailblazer signs shall be attached to utility poles, where such poles are appropriately located. Only where utility poles or other sign posts are not available shall hospital trailblazer signs be
attached to posts installed exclusively for display of the trailblazer sign. Specific placement shall be approved
by the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering and Parking and, for signs placed on utility poles, the Commissioner
of Cleveland Public Power.
(c) Vertical and Lateral Clearance. Each hospital trailblazer sign shall be set back at least two (2) feet from
the curb face or as permitted by the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering and Parking. The bottom of each sign
shall be approximately 7-10 feet above the level of the adjoining street surface, as approved by the Commissioner
of Traffic Engineering and Parking.
Section 511.07 Installation, Ownership and Maintenance
(a) Manufacture, installation, maintenance, and replacement of hospital trailblazer signs shall be at the sole
cost and responsibility of the subject hospital or hospitals or its designated agent or agents. The signs shall
remain property of the hospital or hospitals or its agent or agents.

(b) All signs shall be maintained in good condition. Signs in deteriorated or damaged condition, or signs that
contain obsolete information shall be repaired, replaced or removed upon the order of the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering and Parking.
Section 511.08 Encroachment Application Permit Required
Encroachment Permits are required for placement of all hospital trailblazer signs. Applications shall be as follows:
(a) Comprehensive Sign Location Plan. Not later than six (6) months after the effective date of this chapter,
all hospitals shall submit to the City Planning Commission a comprehensive citywide plan for the placement of
such signs. The plan shall indicate the general location of each proposed sign and each existing sign to be
retained, and the name or names of each hospital listed on each sign. The plan shall demonstrate how the number of signs will be minimized by coordinating the signage needs of hospitals that share access routes. The City
Planning Commission shall review the plan with respect to the General Locational Standards set forth in Section 511.05 and shall either approve or disapprove the plan within 45 days of receipt of a complete plan, unless
the applicant hospitals request an extension in this time period to permit preparation of recommended revisions.
The Commission shall consult with the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering and Parking prior to approving the
plan.
(b) Encroachment Permit Application. Subsequent to approval of a comprehensive sign location plan by the
City Planning Commission, any hospital or hospitals seeking to install hospital trailblazer signs shall apply for
an Encroachment Permit from the Director of Public Service. The application shall include the following information:
(1) a written description of the proposed encroachment or encroachments, including the dimensions, height,
color and construction materials of each sign, as well as the name or names of each hospital listed on each sign;
(2) a sketch of each proposed sign, drawn to scale and marked with dimensions and colors;
(3) a detailed description of the proposed location or locations of the encroachment in narrative and plan form;
(4) a detailed description of the method of attachment to a permanent structure or to the ground;
(5) written consent of the Councilmember in whose ward the encroachment is to be located; and
(6) any other information that the Director of Public Service deems necessary.
(c) Review and Approval of Encroachment Permit Application. The Director of Public Service shall promptly
refer the Encroachment Permit application to the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering and Parking, the Director of the City Planning Commission and, if applicable, the Commissioner of Cleveland Public Power, each of
whom shall review the application for consistency with the standards established in this chapter, the approved
comprehensive sign location plan, and other applicable City standards.
(d) Revocation of Encroachment Permits. The Director of Public Service shall revoke the Encroachment Permit for any sign that is not maintained in accordance with this chapter.
Section 511.09 Pre-existing Signs
(a) Submission of Information. As part of the comprehensive sign location plan to be submitted to the City
Planning Commission pursuant to division (a) of Section 511.08, each hospital shall submit a complete listing of
all existing hospital trailblazer signs it installed prior to the effective date of this chapter. The listing shall
include the location of each sign, a notation indicating whether the hospital proposes to retain, remove or replace
each sign, the ordinance number of the
applicable Encroachment Permit for each sign, and a photograph of
each sign, or sign type, marked with the dimensions of the sign panel.
(b) Conforming Signs. Any sign determined by the Director of the City Planning Commission to be substantially conforming to these- guidelines shall be permitted to remain in place. However, if there is no record of an
Encroachment Permit for any such sign, the subject hospital shall apply for an Encroachment Permit within 30
days of receipt of written notification from said Director.
(c) Nonconforming Signs. Any sign determined by the Director of the City Planning Commission to be substantially nonconforming to the standards of this chapter shall be removed by the subject hospital within 30 days
after receipt of written notice from said Director, except in the case of a sign which the hospital proposes to
replace. For such signs, the hospital shall submit an Encroachment Permit application for the replacement sign
to the Director of Public Service within 30 days of approval of the Comprehensive Sign Location Plan. The nonconforming sign shall be removed and replaced within 30 days of the issuance of an Encroachment Permit.
Section 511.10 Variations and Appeals
The Commissioner of Traffic Engineering and Parking may vary the standards established in this chapter to
the extent necessary, in the determination of the Commission, to ensure traffic safety and to better direct the
motorist in particular instances. Decisions of any City official with respect to hospital trailblazer signs may be
appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with applicable regulations and procedures.
Section 511.11 Insurance and Liability
The recipient of an Encroachment Permit for a hospital trailblazer sign shall hold the City harmless from any
and all liability, for any reason whatsoever, occasioned upon the installation and use of each such device, other
than liability arising from any negligent act or omission which is solely attributable to the City, and shall furnish, at sign owner’s expense, such general commercial liability insurance as shall protect said owner and the
City from all claims for damage to property or bodily injury, including death, which may arise from operation
under the permit or in connection therewith.
Such policy shall name the City as an additional insured, shall be in an amount of not less than One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) combined single limit for any injury to persons and/or damage to property and
shall provide that the insurance coverage shall not be cancelled or reduced by the insurance carrier without thirty (30) days prior written notice to the City.
A certificate of insurance shall be provided to the City with the required application for an Encroachment Permit and shall be maintained before and during installation of such device and throughout the period that the
permit for the encroachment is in effect.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 375-96.
By Councilman Melena.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor and the Administration to
plan for the utilization of clean
material from the demolition of
Cleveland
Municipal
Stadium
to
expand the Cuyahoga County Commissioners Reef in order to create
the largest freshwater artificial reef
system in the world.
Whereas, since the late 1700’s the
Japanese have successfully used
artificial reef technology to create
and
enhance
coastal
fishing
grounds; and
Whereas, the Western Basin of

Lake Erie is known as the “Walleye Capital of the World” because
this area produces more walleye per
hectare than any other lake in the
world; and
Whereas, the Western Basin is
shallow and dotted with islands and
natural reefs which provide necessary habitat for many fish species
including bass, perch and walleye;
and
Whereas, the Central Basin is
deeper, larger and lacks the necessary near shore productive bottom
structures
nature
provided
the
Western Basin; and
Whereas, since the central basin
lacks the near shore structures necessary to fish habitats the Central
Basin fishing areas are not within

326

safe running distance for smaller
boats; and
Whereas, in the 1980’s the North
Central Ohio Sea Grant Committee
caused the creation of artificial
reefs in Lake Erie off the coast of
Lorain and Cuyahoga Counties; and
Whereas, in 1984 the Cuyahoga
County Commissioners contributed
$62,500.00 towards the artificial reef
off the Cuyahoga County Coast; and
Whereas, said artificial reef is
known as the “Cuyahoga County
Commissioner’s Reef”; and
Whereas, in 1984, the Cuyahoga
County
Commissioners
estimated
that the artificial reef off the Cuyahoga County Coast was expected to
inject over 50 million dollars into
the local economy; and

March 6, 1996
Whereas, studies of the Cuyahoga
County Commissioner’s Reef have
shown the reef to have exceeded
expectations in its impact on fishing in the Central Basin; and
Whereas, an expansion of the
existing artificial reef will further
concentrate fish within a given area
near shore; and
Whereas, artificial reef expansion
will create permanent habitats for
many fish species by providing
food,
shelter,
protection
and
a
spawning area; and
Whereas, the expansion of near
shore permanent fish habitat will
benefit
the
Cleveland
economy
through non-local anglers’ expenditures of gas, food, bait, tackle and
overnight lodging; and
Whereas, if the proposed settlement between the NFL and the City
of Cleveland is approved, Cleveland
Municipal Stadium will be demolished and a new facility will be
built to house the Cleveland Browns
NFL franchise; and
Whereas, in order to demolish
Municipal
Stadium
lead
and
asbestos abatement of the structure
must be completed prior to demolition; and
Whereas, upon demolition of the
structure, a huge quantity of clean
brick and concrete rubble will need
to be transported off site and disposed of; and
Whereas, the brick and concrete
rubble created by the proposed
demolition of Municipal Stadium
would only need to be transported
across the street to the Port of
Cleveland and hauled to the current
reef site for use in expansion of the
reef; and
Whereas, the use of the brick and
concrete rubble for expansion of the
Cuyahoga County Commissioner’s
Reef will save hundreds of thousands of dollars in the current
demolition budget for the proposed
stadium; and
Whereas, the use of said concrete
and brick rubble to extend the
Cuyahoga County Commissioner’s
Reef
will
save
scarce
landfill
resources and create an asset at
minimal cost which will survive for
many generations beyond the proposed facility; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that plans for a
new artificial reef to benefit the
Cleveland
area
should
proceed
simultaneously with plans for the
future of Cleveland Municipal Stadium; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Mayor and the Administration to
plan for the utilization of clean
material from the demolition of
Cleveland
Municipal
Stadium
to
expanded
the
Cuyahoga
County
Commissioners Reef in order to create the largest freshwater artificial
reef system in the world.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to the Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

contribution to the Cleveland public

Whereas, the law firm of Jones,
Day, Reavis and Pogue (“Jones,
Day”) has received a substantial
amount of fees from the defense of

school system out of the monies
received from Art Modell and the
Cleveland Stadium Corporation; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
