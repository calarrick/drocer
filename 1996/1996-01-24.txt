601.06 Requirements for Criminal
Liability
(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of
the following apply:
(1) His liability is based on conduct which includes either a voluntary act, or an omission to perform
an act or duty which he is capable
of performing;
(2) He has the requisite degree of
culpability for each element as to
which a culpable mental state is
specified by the section defining the
offense.
(b) When the section defining an
offense does not specify any degree
of culpability, and plainly indicates
a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in
such section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of
the offense. When the section neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose
strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the
offense.
(c) As used in this section:
(1) Possession is a voluntary act
if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or
was aware of his control thereof for
a sufficient time to have ended his
possession.
(2) Reflexes, convulsions, body
movements during unconsciousness
or sleep, and body movements that
are not otherwise a product of the
actor’s
volition,
are
involuntary
acts.
(3) “Culpability” means purpose,
knowledge, recklessness or negli-

61

11
gence, as defined in Section 601.07,
or any other specific mental state
required by any section of this Code.
(RC 2901.21)
601.08 Attempt
(a) No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is sufficient culpability for the
commission of an offense, shall
engage in conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in
the offense.
(b) It is no defense to a charge
under this section that, in retrospect, commission of the offense
which was the object of the attempt
was either factually or legally
impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that offense could
have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
(c) No person who is convicted of
committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an
offense, or of conspiracy to commit
an offense shall be convicted of an
attempt to commit the same offense
in violation of this section.
(d) It is an affirmative defense to
a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his
criminal purpose.
(e) Whoever violates this section
is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit any
misdemeanor is a misdemeanor of
the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the case of
an attempt to commit an offense
other than a violation of RC Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense
attempted is a felony under the
Revised Code, and a misdemeanor of
the fourth degree if the offense
attempted is a misdemeanor. An
attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy,
is not an offense under this section.
(RC 2923.02)
601.09 Complicity
(a) No person, acting with the
kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do
any of the following:
(1) Solicit or procure another to
commit the offense;
(2) Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
(3) Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of RC
2923.01;
(4) Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the
offense.
(b) It is no defense to a charge
under this section that no person
with whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
(c) No person shall be convicted
of complicity under this section
unless an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity in an attempt
to commit an offense in violation of
Section 601.08.
(d) If an alleged accomplice of
the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the
defendant is charged with complicity in the commission of or an
attempt to commit an offense, an
attempt to commit an offense, or an
offense, the court, when it charges
the jury, shall state substantially
the following:

12
“The testimony of an accomplice
does
not
become
inadmissible
because of his complicity, moral
turpitude, or self-interest, but the
admitted or claimed complicity of a
witness may affect his credibility
and make his testimony subject to
grave suspicion, and require that it
be weighed with great caution.”
“It is for you, as jurors, in the
light of all the facts presented to
you from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and worth or its
lack of quality and worth.”
(e) It is an affirmative defense to
a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or
attempt to commit the offense, the
actor
terminated
his
complicity,
under circumstances manifesting a
complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
(f) Whoever violates this section
is guilty of complicity in the commission of an offense, and shall be
prosecuted and punished as if he
were a principal offender. A charge
of complicity may be stated in terms
of this section, or in terms of the
principal offense. (RC 2923.03)
601.12 Repeat
and
Dangerous
Offenders
As used in Section 601.13:
(a) “Repeat offender” means a
person who has a history of persistent criminal activity, and whose
character and condition reveal a
substantial risk that he will commit
another offense. It is prima-facie
evidence that a person is a repeat
offender if any of the following
apply:
(1) Having been convicted of one
or more offenses of violence, as
defined in RC 2901.01 and Section
60l.01(i), and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any
such offense, he commits a subsequent offense of violence;
(2) Having been convicted of one
or more sex offenses as defined in
RC 2950.01 or Section 619.01, and
having been imprisoned pursuant to
sentence for any such offense, he
commits a subsequent sex offense;
(3) Having been convicted of one
or more theft offenses as defined in
RC 2913.01 or Section 625.01, and
having been imprisoned pursuant to
sentence for any such offense, he
commits a subsequent theft offense;
(4) Having been convicted of one
or more felony drug abuse offenses
as defined in RC Chapter 2925. and
having been imprisoned pursuant to
sentence for any such offense, he
commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
(5) Having been convicted of two
or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for
any such offense, he commits a subsequent offense;
(6) Having
been
convicted
of
three or more offenses of any type
or degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses or
minor misdemeanors, and having
been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, he commits a subsequent offense.
(b) “Dangerous offender” means a
person
who
has
committed
an
offense, whose history, character,
and condition reveal a substantial
risk that he will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been
characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive,
or
aggressive
behavior with heedless indifference
to the consequences.
(c) “Actual incarceration” means
that an offender is required to be
imprisoned for the stated period of

The City Record
time to which he is sentenced that
is specified as a term of actual
incarceration. If a person is sentenced to a term of actual incarceration, the court shall not suspend
his term of actual incarceration, and
shall not grant him probation or
shock probation, pursuant to RC
2929.51, 2947.061, 2951.02, or 2951.04,
and the department of rehabilitation
and correction or the adult parole
authority shall not, pursuant to RC
Chapter 2967. its rules adopted pursuant to RC Chapter 2967., 5120., or
5149. of the Revised Code, grant him
a furlough for employment or education, a furlough for being a trustworthy prisoner other than a furlough
pursuant
to
division
(A)(1)(a) or (b) of RC 2967.27,
parole, emergency parole, or shock
parole until after the expiration of
his term of actual incarceration,
diminished
as
provided
in
RC
2967.19, 2967.193, and 5145.11.
An offender who is sentenced to
a term of actual incarceration may
be transferred from an institution
operated by the department of rehabilitation and correction to the custody of the department of mental
health or the department of mental
retardation and developmental disabilities, as provided in RC 5120.17,
and shall be credited with all time
served in the custody of the department
of
mental
health
or
the
department of mental retardation
and
developmental
disabilities
against the term of actual incarceration.
(d) “Deadly
weapon”
has
the
same meaning as in section 627.01.
(RC 2929.01)
601.13 Considerations for Imposing Penalties
(a) In determining whether to
impose imprisonment or a fine, or
both, for a misdemeanor, and in
determining the term of imprisonment and the amount and method of
payment of a fine, the court shall
consider the risk that the offender
will commit another offense and the
need for protecting the public from
the risk; the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history,
character, and condition of the
offender and his need for correctional or rehabilitative treatment;
any statement made by the victim,
if the offense is a misdemeanor
specified in division (A) of RC
2930.01;
and
the
ability
and
resources of the offender and the
nature of the burden that payment
of a fine will impose on him.
(b) The following do not control
the court’s discretion, but shall be
considered in favor of imposing
imprisonment for a misdemeanor:
(1) The offender is a repeat or
dangerous offender;
(2) Regardless of whether or not
the offender knew the age of the
victim, the victim of the offense was
sixty-five years of age or older, permanently and totally disabled, or
less than eighteen years of age at
the time of the commission of the
offense.
(c) The following do not control
the court’s discretion, but shall be
considered against imposing imprisonment for a misdemeanor:
(1) The offense neither caused
nor
threatened
serious
physical
harm to persons or property, or the
offender did not contemplate that it
would so do;
(2) The offense was the result of
circumstances unlikely to recur;

62

January 24, 1996
(3) The victim of the offense
induced or facilitated it;
(4) There are substantial grounds
tending to excuse or justify the
offense, though failing to establish
a defense;
(5) The
offender
acted
under
strong provocation;
(6) The offender has no history of
prior delinquency or criminal activity, or has led a law-abiding life for
a substantial time before commission of the present offense;
(7) The offender is likely to
respond quickly to correctional or
rehabilitative treatment.
(d) The criteria listed in subsections (b) and (c) hereof shall not
be construed to limit the matters
which may be considered in determining whether to impose imprisonment for a misdemeanor.
(e) The court shall not impose a
fine in addition to imprisonment for
a misdemeanor, unless a fine is specially adapted to deterrence of the
offense or the correction of the
offender, the offense has proximately resulted in physical harm to
the person or property of another, or
the offense was committed for hire
or for purpose of gain.
(f) The court shall not impose a
fine or fines which, in the aggregate and to the extent not suspended by the court, exceeds the amount
which the offender is or will be able
to pay by the method and within the
time allowed without undue hardship to himself or his dependents, or
will prevent him from making restitution or reparation to the victim of
his offense.
(g) At the time of sentencing or
as soon as possible after sentencing,
the court shall notify the victim of
the offense of his right to file an
application for an award of reparations pursuant to RC 2743.51 to
2743.72. (RC 2929.22)
601.99 Penalties for Misdemeanors
(a) Whoever is convicted of or
pleads guilty to a misdemeanor as
classified in the Codified Ordinances (the “offender”), other than
a minor misdemeanor, shall be
imprisoned for a definite term or
fined, or both, which term of imprisonment and fine shall be fixed by
the court as provided in this section.
Whoever is convicted of or pleads
guilty to committing, attempting to
commit, or complicity in committing
a violation of Section 623.01 that is
a misdemeanor, or a violation of
division (a)(2) of Section 623.02
when the means used are fire or
explosion, shall be required to reimburse agencies for their investigation or prosecution costs in accordance with RC 2929.28.

621.07, 621.09, 621.10, 621.11, 623.01,
623.02, 623.03, 623.04, 625.05, 625.07,

these Codified Ordinances was sixty
(60) years of age or older at the
time of the commission of the
offense:
(1) In the case of offenses which
are classified misdemeanors of the

offender’s fine at $1,000.00 and in
addition to said fine, shall sentence
the offender to not less than sixty
(60) days’ and not more than six (6)
months’ imprisonment.
(2) In the case of offenses which
are classified minor misdemeanors
or misdemeanors of the second,
third or fourth degree, the penalty
for the offense shall be the next

that which is set forth in the section defining the offense.
A. In the case of offenses which
become misdemeanors of the first

days’ imprisonment.
(3) Where applicable, the court

(a) No person shall maliciously,
or willfully and without the consent
of the owner, administer poison,
except a licensed veterinarian acting in such capacity, to a farm animal, dog, cat, poultry, or any other
domestic animal that is the property of another; and no person shall,

misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
(RC 959.99(C))
603.09 Cruelty to Animals
(a) No person shall:
(1) Torture an animal, deprive
one of necessary sustenance, unnecessarily or cruelly beat, needlessly

during such confinement with a sufficient quantity of good wholesome
food and water;
(2) Impound or confine an animal
without affording it, during such
confinement, access to shelter from
wind, rain, snow or excessive direct
sunlight, if it can reasonably be
expected that the animal would otherwise become sick or in some other
way suffer. This subsection (a)(2)
does not apply to animals impounded or confined prior to slaughter.
For the purpose of this section,

developed from the earth’s contour,
tree development or vegetation;
(3) Carry or convey an animal in
a cruel or inhumane manner;
(4) Keep animals other than cattle, poultry or fowl, swine, sheep, or

63

13
(b) Upon the written request of
the owner or person in custody of
any particular shipment of livestock, which written request shall
be separate and apart from any
printed bill of lading or other railroad form, the length of time in
which
such
livestock
may
be
detained in any cars or compartments without food, water, and
attention, may be extended to thirty-six hours without penalty therefor. This section does not prevent
the dehorning of cattle.

hundred dollars ($300.00) or more.
(b) Where more than one item of

subsection (a) hereof, is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
In
prosecuting
a
single
offense under this section, it is not
necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series. It
is sufficient to allege and prove
that the offender, within a given
span of time committed one or more
theft offense in his same employment, capacity or relationship to
another.
(d) The following criteria shall
be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a
theft offense:
(1) The value of an heirloom,
memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing which
has intrinsic worth to its owner and
which is either irreplaceable or is
replaceable only on the expenditure
of substantial time, effort or money,
is the amount which would compensate the owner for its loss.
(2) The value of personal effects
and household goods, and of materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business, trade, occupation or avocation
of its owner, which property is not
covered under subsection (d)(1)
hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its purpose regardless
of its age or condition, is the cost
of replacing such property with new
property of like kind and quality.
(3) The value of any property,
real or personal, not covered under
subsection (d)(1) or (2) hereof, and
the value of services, is the fair
market value of such property or
services. As used in this section

consideration which a buyer would
give and a seller would accept for
property or services, assuming that
the buyer is willing to buy and the
seller is willing to sell, that both
are fully informed as to all facts

The City Record
material to the transaction and that
neither is under any compulsion to
act.
(e) Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
(1) When the property involved is
personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at
which such property was held for
sale is prima-facie evidence of its
value.
(2) When the property involved is
a security or commodity traded on
an exchange, the closing price or, if
there is no closing price, the asked
price, given in the latest market
quotation prior to the offense, is
prima-facie evidence of the value of
such security or commodity.
(3) When the property involved is
livestock, poultry or raw agricultural products for which a local
market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the
offense is prima-facie evidence of
the value of such livestock, poultry
or product.
(4) When the property involved is
a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the
value of such instrument.
(5) When the property involved is
a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other
instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property, the face
value or, if there is no face value,
the value of the property covered by
the instrument less any payment
necessary to receive the property, is
prima-facie evidence of the value of
the instrument.
(6) When the property involved is
a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or
other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to receive property or
services, the face value or, if there
is no face value, the value of the
property or services which may be
received thereby, is prima-facie evidence of the value of such instrument.
(7) When the services involved
are gas, electricity, water, telephone, transportation, shipping or
other services for which the rate is
established by law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence
of the value of such services.
(8) When the services involved
are services for which the rate is
not established by law, and the
offender has been notified prior to
the offense of the rate for such services, either in writing or orally, or
by posting in a manner reasonably
calculated to come to the attention
of potential offenders, the rate contained in such notice is prima-facie
evidence of the value of such services. (RC 2913.61)

times during a hearing. The parties

not occurred, then the Fair Housing
Review Board shall dismiss the
complaint by preparing a written
notice of dismissal, including the
reasons therefor, and notify the parties of the dismissal, within five (5)
days, by serving a copy of the
notice of dismissal by certified mail

be
a
prospective purchaser, occupant, or

85

35
sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, ethnic group or
Vietnam-era or disabled veteran status, of occupants or prospective
occupants of other housing accommodations in the neighborhood;

to act, any person who purports or
represents himself to be a prospective
seller,
purchaser,
occupant,
landlord,
or
tenant
of
housing
accommodations, in connection with
the sale or rental of housing accommodations, so as to promote or tend
to promote the continuance or maintenance of segregated housing or so
as to retard, obstruct, or discourage
integrated housing on or in any
street, block, or neighborhood;
(c) Discriminate against any person who purports or represents himself to be a prospective seller, purchaser, occupant, landlord, or tenant
of housing accommodations by any
influence, suggestion, act or failure

housing accommodations or in the
furnishing of information, services,
or facilities relative thereto because

disability, ethnic group or Vietnamera or disabled veteran status of
any person.
665.07 Watch Area Designation
(a) Upon consideration of the factors listed in division (b) of Section
665.08, the Community Relations
Board may designate any area of
the City as a “watch area.” A watch
area designation shall signify that
the area is sensitive to change and
that real estate brokers, agents,
sales persons or other persons who
are licensed or required to be
licensed pursuant to RC Chapter
4735 are advised to solicit the area
only with due caution. Whenever an
area of the City is designated as a
watch area, the Community Relations Board shall monitor the situation and actively work towards
eliminating or reducing the factors
that caused the area to be designated as a watch area. In any area
designated as a watch area, the
Community Relations Board may
seek a voluntary real estate solicitation moratorium for such length
of time as appropriate, but only if
such voluntary moratorium is warranted in the opinion of the Community Relations Board by the circumstances in a given watch area.
(b) At any time that an area is
not under a non-solicitation area
designation
pursuant
to
Section
665.08, the Community Relations
Board may cancel a watch area designation if it finds that the factors
that caused the area to be designated as a watch area have been
eliminated or reduced and that the
designation is no longer warranted.
(c) Upon each designation or cancellation of a watch area, the Community
Relations
Board
shall
promptly notify the Mayor and
Council in writing and publish a
notice in the City Record or newspaper of general circulation describing the boundaries of the area by
reference to streets, census tracts or
common landmarks. Each designation or cancellation shall take effect
upon publication. The Community
Relations Board shall maintain a
list of designated watch areas and
make it available to any person
upon request.

36
665.08 Non-solicitation
(a) No real estate broker, agent,
sales representative or other person
who is licensed or required to be
licensed pursuant to RC Chapter
4735 shall solicit the owner or occupant of any housing accommodations located within a non-solicitation area designated by the Fair
Housing Review Board.
(b) Any area that the Community
Relations Board has designated as
a watch area may be designated by
the Fair Housing Review Board as
a non-solicitation area for an initial
period of up to forty-five days upon
making written findings based on
substantial evidence introduced at a
public hearing that real estate solicitation in the area is or is likely to
cause or contribute to blockbusting
or panic selling. In determining
whether
a
non-solicitation
area
should be designated, the Fair
Housing Review Board shall consider the following factors, and such
other factors it may deem appropriate, as they pertain to the area
under consideration:
(1) The frequency of real estate
solicitation;
(2) The content of the solicitations;
(3) The racial composition and
rate of racial change;
(4) The frequency of home sales
and other real estate activity; and
(5) The number, severity and history of racial incidents.
(c) The Fair Housing Review
Board may extend for one time the
designation of a non-solicitation
area for a period of forty-five (45)
days upon making written findings
based on substantial evidence introduced at a public hearing that continuation of the solicitation ban is
warranted. The public hearing to
extend the designation of a nonsolicitation area shall be held before
the date on which the designation
is scheduled to expire, but not more
than ten days before the date on
which the designation is scheduled
to expire. If an area is designated
as a non-solicitation area and the
designation is extended one time,
the designation shall cease after the
extension expires.
(d) The Fair Housing Review
Board may, following public hearing, cancel the designation of a nonsolicitation area or extension of any
such designation made pursuant to
this section.
(e) If a designation of a non-solicitation area expires without extension or is cancelled, or if an extension made pursuant to division (c)
of this section expires or is cancelled, the area may be designated
anew as a non-solicitation area pursuant to division (b) of this section.
(f) Upon expiration or cancellation of a designation or extension of
a non-solicitation area, the area
shall remain a watch area until the
watch area designation is cancelled
by the Community Relations Board
pursuant to division (b) of Section
665.07.
(g) Upon each designation, extension or cancellation made pursuant
to this section, the Fair Housing
Review Board shall promptly notify
the Mayor and Council in writing
and publish a notice in the City
Record or newspaper of general circulation describing the boundaries
of the area by reference to streets,
census tracts or common landmarks.
Each designation, extension or cancellation shall take effect upon publication. The Fair Housing Review
Board shall maintain a list of des-

make it available to any person
upon request.

Ord. No. 91-96.
By Councilmen Polensek, McGuirk
and
Rokakis
(by
departmental
request).
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
various sections of the City’s Traffic Code; and to repeal existing sections of said code.
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly has amended certain sections of
the State Criminal Code and added
new sections thereto; and
Whereas,
such
amendments
should be reflected in the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
since ordinances which are enacted
as an exercise of the City’s police
powers are required by the Ohio
Constitution not to conflict with the
general Sate law; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that violators
may be immediately charged under
the City’s municipal code instead of
the State statutes and providing for
the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

indicated by such arrow, or such
other movement as is permitted by
other indications shown at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic shall
yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
(3) Unless otherwise directed by
a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 413.05, pedestrians
facing any green signal, except

arrow, may proceed across the roadway
within
any
marked
or
unmarked crosswalk.
(b) Steady Yellow Indication.
(1) Vehicular traffic facing a
steady circular yellow or yellow
arrow signal is thereby warned that
the related green movement is being
terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall
not enter the intersection.

pedestrian shall then start to cross
the roadway.
(c) Steady Red Indication.
(1) Vehicular traffic facing a
steady red signal alone shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, but if
none, before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection,
or if none, then before entering the
intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is
shown except as provided in subsections (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
(2) Unless a sign is in place prohibiting a right turn as provided in
subsection (c) (5) hereof, vehicular
traffic facing a steady red signal
may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn after stopping as required by subsection
(c)(1) hereof. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic
lawfully using the intersection.
(3) Unless a sign is in place prohibiting a left turn as provided in
subsection (c) (5) hereof, vehicular
traffic facing a steady red signal on
a one-way street that intersects
another one-way street on which
traffic moves to the left may cautiously make a left turn into the
one-way street after stopping as
required by subsection (c)(1) hereof, and yielding the right of way to

46
pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic
lawfully using the intersection.
(4) Unless otherwise directed by
a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 413.05, pedestrians
facing a steady red signal alone
shall not enter the roadway.
(5) Council may by ordinance, as
provided in Sections 413.09 and
413.10, prohibit a right or left turn
against a steady red signal at any
intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice thereof are posted at the intersection.
(d) Signals; Locations Other than
Intersections. In the event an official traffic control signal is erected
and maintained at a place other
than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable
except as to those provisions which
by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be
made at a sign or marking on the
pavement indicating where the stop
shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop
shall be made at the signal. (RC
4511.13)
413.07 Unauthorized Signs and Signals; Biding from View; Advertising
(a) No person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of
any street any unauthorized sign,
signal, marking or device which
purports to be or is an imitation of

attempts to direct the movement of
traffic, or which hides from view or
interferes with the effectiveness of
any traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor
shall any public authority permit,
upon any street any traffic sign or
signal bearing thereon any commercial advertising. This section
does not prohibit the erection upon
private property adjacent to streets

(d) In any proceeding arising out
of one incident, a person may be
charged with a violation of division
(a)(1) and a violation of division
(b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section,
but he may not be convicted of more
than one violation of these divisions.
(e) Evidence; Tests; Immunity. In
any criminal prosecution for a violation of this section, the court may
admit evidence on the concentration
of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or alcohol and drugs of abuse in the defendant’s blood, breath, urine or other
bodily substance at the time of the
alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis of the defendant’s
blood, urine, breath or other bodily
substance withdrawn within two
hours of the time of the alleged violation.
When a person submits to a blood
test at the request of a police officer under RC 4511.191, only a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician or chemist shall
withdraw blood for the purpose of
determining its alcohol, drug, or
alcohol and drug content. This limitation does not apply to the taking
of breath or urine specimens. A
physician, a registered nurse or a
qualified technician or chemist may
refuse to withdraw blood for the
purpose of determining the alcohol,

January 24, 1996
drug, or alcohol and drug content of
the blood, if in his opinion the physical welfare of the person would be
endangered by the withdrawing of
blood.
Such bodily substance shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Ohio Director
of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the
Director of Health pursuant to RC
3701.143.
If there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than ten-hundredths of one percent (0.10%) by
weight of alcohol in the defendant’s
blood,
less
than
ten-hundredths
(0.10) of one gram by weight of
alcohol per 210 liters of his breath
or less than fourteen-hundredths
(0.14) of one gram by weight of
alcohol per 100 milliliters of his
urine, such fact may be considered
with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence
of the defendant. This paragraph
does not limit or affect a criminal
prosecution for a violation of division (c) of this section relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in the
blood, breath or urine.
Upon the request of the person
who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to him, his attorney or agent,
immediately upon the completion of
the chemical test analysis.
The person tested may have a
physician, a registered nurse or a
qualified technician or chemist of
his own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests in addition to
any administered at the request of
a police officer, and shall be so
advised. The failure or inability to
obtain an additional chemical test
by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to
the chemical test or tests taken at
the request of a police officer.
Any physician, registered nurse or
qualified technician or chemist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, and any hospital, first-aid station or clinic at
which blood is withdrawn from a
person pursuant to this section, is
immune from criminal liability, and
from civil liability that is based
upon a claim of assault and battery
or based upon any other claim that
is not in the nature of a claim of
malpractice, for any act performed
in withdrawing blood from a person.
(RC 4511.19(B) to (D))
433.02 Operation in Willful or
Wanton Disregard of Safety
(a) No person shall operate a
vehicle on any street or highway in
willful or wanton disregard of the
safety of persons or property. (RC
4511.20)
(b) No person shall operate a
vehicle on any public or private
property other than streets or highways, in willful or wanton disregard of the safety of persons or
property.
This subsection does not apply to
the competitive operation of vehicles on public or private property
when the owner of such property
knowingly permits such operation
thereon. (RC 4511.201; Ord. No. 168476. Passed 6-29-76, eff. 7-6-76)
433.03 Maximum Speed Limits;
Assured Clear Distance Ahead
(a) No person shall operate a
motor vehicle at a speed greater or
less than is reasonable or proper,
having due regard to the traffic,

The City Record
surface and width of the street or
highway and any other conditions,
and no person shall drive any motor
vehicle in and upon any street or
highway at a greater speed than
will permit him to bring it to a stop
within the assured clear distance
ahead.
(b) It is prima-facie lawful, in the
absence of a lower limit declared
pursuant to RC 4511.21 by the Ohio
Director of Transportation or Council, for the operator of a motor vehicle to operate the same at a speed
not exceeding the following:
(1) A. Twenty miles per hour in
school zones during school recess
and while children are going to or
leaving school during the opening
or closing hours, and when twenty
miles per hour school speed limit
signs are erected; except, that on
controlled-access
highways
and
expressways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without
pedestrian opening, the speed shall
be governed by division (b) (4) of
this section and on freeways, if the
right-of-way line fence has been
erected without pedestrian opening,
the speed shall be governed by division (b) (7) of this section. The end
of every school zone may be marked
by a sign indicating the end of the
zone. Nothing in this section or in
the manual and specifications for a
uniform system of traffic control
devices shall be construed to require
school zones to be indicated by
signs equipped with flashing or
other lights or giving other special
notice of the hours in which the
school zone speed limit is in effect.
B. As used in this section, “school’’
means any school chartered under
RC 3301.16 and any nonchartered
school that during the preceding
year filed with the Department of
Education in compliance with rule
3301-35-08 of the Ohio Administrative
Code, a copy of the school’s report
for the parents of the school’s pupils
certifying that the school meets
Ohio minimum standards for nonchartered, non-tax supported schools

C. As used in this section, “school
zone’’ means that portion of a street
or
highway
passing
a
school
fronting upon the street or highway
that is encompassed by projecting
the school property lines to the
fronting street or highway, and also
includes that portion of a state
highway. Upon request from the
City for streets and highways under
its jurisdiction and that portion of
a state highway under the jurisdiction of the Ohio Director of Transportation, the Director may extend
the traditional school zone boundaries. The distances in divisions (b)
(1) C.1. to 3. of this section shall not
exceed 300 feet per approach per
direction
and
are
bounded
by
whichever of the following distances or combinations thereof the
Director approves as most appropriate:
1. The distance encompassed by
projecting the school building lines
normal to the fronting highway and
extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction:
2. The distance encompassed by
projecting the school property lines
intersecting the fronting highway
and extending a distance of 300 feet
on each approach direction;
3. The distance encompassed by
the special marking of the pavement for a principal school pupil

97

47
crosswalk plus a distance of 300
feet on each approach direction of
highway.
Nothing in this section shall be
construed to invalidate the Director’s initial action on August 9, 1976,
establishing all school zones at the
traditional school zone boundaries
defined by projecting school property lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in
divisions (b) (1)A. and C. of this
section.
D. As used in this division, “crosswalk’’ has the meaning given that
term in Section 401.14. The Director
may, upon request by resolution of
Council, and upon submission by the
City of such engineering, traffic and
other information as the Director
considers necessary, designate a
school zone on any portion of a
State route lying within the City
that includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or
leaving a school during recess and
opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to
the nearest point of the crosswalk
is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a
school zone shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet on
each approach direction of the State
route;
(2) Twenty-five miles per hour in
all other portions of the City, except
on State routes outside business districts, through highways outside
business districts and alleys;

accordance with criteria issued by
the federal highway administration
or established by the “Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act of 1991,’’ 105 Stat. 1968, 23
U.S.C.A. 154(a), for any motor vehicle weighing eight thousand pounds
or less empty weight and any commercial bus, except fifty-five miles
per hour for operators of any motor
vehicle weighing in excess of eight
thousand pounds empty weight and
any noncommercial bus.
(9) A speed posted on signs erected on streets or highways in a construction zone advising motorists
that increased penalties apply for
certain traffic violations occurring
on streets or highways in a construction zone during actual hours
of work within the construction
zone.
A. As used in this section, “con-

48
struction zone’’ means that lane or
portion of a street or highway open
to vehicular traffic and adjacent to
a lane, berm or shoulder of a street
or highway within which lane,
berm,
or
shoulder
construction,
reconstruction, resurfacing, or any
other work of a repair or maintenance nature, including public utility work, is being conducted, commencing with the point where the
first worker or piece of equipment
is located and ending where the last
worker or piece of equipment is
located. (RC 5501.27)
(c) It is prima-facie unlawful for
any person to exceed any of the
speed
limitations
in
divisions
(b)(1)A. to (b)(6) of this section, or
any declared pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities and it is unlawful for any person to exceed the speed limitation
in division (d) of this section. No
person shall be convicted of more
than one violation of this section for
the same conduct, although violations of more than one provision of
this section may be charged in the
alternative in a single affidavit.
(d) No person shall operate a
motor vehicle, trackless trolley, or
streetcar upon a street or highway
as follows:
(1) At a speed exceeding fifty-five
miles per hour, except upon a freeway as provided in division (b)(8)

empty weight or a noncommercial
bus as prescribed in division (b) (8)
of this section, at a speed exceeding fifty-five miles per hour upon a
freeway as provided in that division.
(e) In every charge of violation
of this section the affidavit and
warrant shall specify the time,
place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to have driven, and
in charges made in reliance upon
division (c) of this section also the
speed which divisions (b)(1)A. to
(b)(6) of this section, or a limit
declared pursuant to this section
declares is prima-facie lawful at the
time and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits
where a person is alleged to have
driven at a greater speed than will
permit him to bring the vehicle to
a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at
which the defendant is alleged to
have driven.
(f) When a speed in excess of
both a prima-facie limitation and
the limitation in division (d) of this
section is alleged, the defendant
shall be charged in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a
violation indicated of both divisions
(b)(1)A. to (b)(6) of this section, or
of a limit declared pursuant to this
section by the Director or local
authorities, and of division (d) of
this section. If the court finds a violation
of
divisions
(b)(1)A.
to
(b)(6) of this section, or a limit
declared pursuant to this section
has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction under such division and dismiss the charge under
division (d) of this section. If it
finds no violation of divisions (b)
(1)A. to (b) (6) of this section or a
limit declared pursuant to this sec-

The City Record
tion, it shall then consider whether
the evidence supports a conviction
under division (d) of this section.
(g) Points shall be assessed for
violation of a limitation under division (d) of this section only when
the
court
finds
the
violation
involved a speed of five miles per
hour or more in excess of the posted speed limit.
(h) Whenever the Ohio Director of
Transportation determines upon the
basis of an engineering and traffic
investigation that any speed limit
set forth in divisions (b)(1)A. to (d)
of this section is greater than is reasonable or safe under the conditions
found to exist at any intersection or
other place upon any part of a State
route, the Director shall determine
and declare a reasonable and safe
prima-facie speed limit, which shall
be effective when appropriate signs
giving notice are erected at the
intersection or other part of the
State route.
(i) Whenever Council determines
upon the basis of an engineering
and traffic investigation that the
speed permitted by divisions (b)
(1)A. to (d) of this section, on any
part of a highway under their jurisdiction, is greater than is reasonable and safe under the conditions
found to exist at such location,
Council may by resolution request
the
Director
to
determine
and
declare
a
reasonable
and
safe
prima-facie speed limit. Upon receipt
of such request the Director may
determine and declare a reasonable
and safe prima-facie speed limit at
such location, and if the Director
does so, then such declared speed
limit shall become effective only
when
appropriate
signs
giving
notice thereof are erected at such
location by the City. The Director
may withdraw his declaration of
any prima-facie speed limit whenever in his opinion any altered
prima-facie speed becomes unreasonable, and upon such withdrawal,
the declared prima-facie speed shall
become ineffective and the signs
relating thereto shall be immediately removed by the City.
(j) Council may authorize by ordinance higher prima-facie speeds
than those stated in this section
upon through highways, or upon
highways or portions thereof where
there
are
no
intersections,
or
between widely spaced intersections, provided signs are erected
giving notice of the authorized
speed, but Council shall not modify
or alter the basic rule set forth in
division (a) of this section or in any
event authorize by ordinance a
speed in excess of fifty miles per
hour.
Alteration of prima-facie limits on
State routes by Council shall not be
effective until the alteration has
been approved by the Director. The
Director may withdraw his approval
of any altered prima-facie speed limits whenever in his opinion any
altered prima-facie speed becomes
unreasonable, and upon such withdrawal,
the
altered
prima-facie
speed shall become ineffective and
the signs relating thereto shall be
immediately removed by the City.
(RC 4511.21)
(k) Whenever, in accordance with
RC 4511.21 or this section, the speed
limitations as established herein
have been altered, either higher or
lower, and the appropriate signs
giving notice have been erected as
required, operators of motor vehicles shall be governed by the speed
limitations set forth on such signs.

98

January 24, 1996
It is prima-facie unlawful for any
person to exceed the speed limits
posted upon such signs.
433.04 Stopping or Slow Speed;
Posted Minimum Speeds
(a) No person shall stop or operate a vehicle at such a slow speed
as to impede or block the normal
and reasonable movement of traffic,
except when stopping or reduced
speed is necessary for safe operation or to comply with law.
(b) Whenever the Ohio Director of
Transportation or the Council determine on the basis of an engineering
and traffic investigation that slow
speeds on any part of a controlledaccess
highway,
expressway,
or
freeway consistently impede the
normal and reasonable movement of
traffic, the Director or the Council
may declare a minimum speed limit
below which no person shall operate a motor vehicle, trackless trolley, or street car except when necessary for safe operation or in compliance with law. No minimum
speed limit established hereunder
shall be less than thirty miles per
hour, greater than fifty miles per
hour, nor effective until the provisions of RC 4511.21 and Section
433.03, relating to appropriate signs,
have been fulfilled and the City has
obtained the approval of the Director. (RC 4511.22)
(c) It is prima-facie unlawful for
the operator of a vehicle to operate
such vehicle on any portion of a
controlled-access
highway
at
a
speed less than thirty-five miles per
hour where the speed limit is fifty
miles per hour and at a speed less
than forty miles per hour where the
speed limit is fifty-five miles per
hour.
This limit shall not apply to any
operation on a ramp nor to any person while engaged in maintenance
or construction work on such highway or to any employee of a public
agency while engaged in the performance of his official duties.
433.07 Street Racing and Racing
Prohibited

operation of two or more vehicles
from a point side by side at accelerating speeds in a competitive
attempt to outdistance each other or
the operation of one or more vehicles over common selected course,
from the same point to the same
point, wherein timing is made of the
participating
vehicles
involving
competitive accelerations or speeds.
Persons rendering assistance in
any manner to such competitive use
of vehicles shall be equally charged
as the participants. The operation of
two or more vehicles side by side
either at speeds in excess of primafacie lawful speeds established by
Section 433.03 or rapidly accelerating from a common starting point to
a speed in excess of such primafacie lawful speeds shall be primafacie evidence of street racing.

By Councilmen Rokakis and Patmon.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio House of Representatives
to delay its vote on House Bill 125
until a study is completed on the
impact that narcotics operations in
Cleveland and other major Ohio
cities are having on reducing illegal drug sales.
Whereas, H.B. 125 sponsored by
State Representative Jeff Jacobson
calls for ending the now limited
powers of undercover Police officers
to arrest persons purchasing small
amounts of drugs; and
Whereas, H.B. 125 would eliminate the “at least bulk amount of a
controlled substance” requirement
associated with one type of permissible sale of controlled substances
by a peace officer; and
Whereas, H.B. 125 permits law
enforcement officials to offer to sell
a controlled substance or a counterfeit substance under specified circumstances; and
Whereas, there has been no substantial evidence to show that the
removal of the requirement of having “bulk amount of the controlled
substance” as a condition under
which a peace officer may sell such
controlled substance will be more
effective in winning the war on
drugs; and
Whereas, there needs to be a
major study done by law enforcement officials in Cleveland and
other major cities throughout Ohio
to determine if such a provision will
be more effective in reducing drug
activities in those communities;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby urge the Ohio House of Representatives to delay its vote on H.B.
125, until a study is completed in
the City of Cleveland and other
major Ohio cities to determine if
removing the “bulk-sales” option
from this legislation will effectively curtail illegal drug activity.
Section 2. That Council does hereby urge the Director of Public Safety to commission a study to determine what impact the City’s narcotics operation is having on curtailing drug activity and if the
“bulk-sales” option hampers efforts

January 24, 1996
by the City’s police force to reduce
the sale of drugs.
Section 3. That Council does hereby urge the Director of Public Safety to transmit a copy of the study
when completed to the State House
of Representatives for review.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to
