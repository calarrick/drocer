Res. No. 1624-96.
By Councilman O’Malley.
An emergency resolution declaring an emergency and urging the
United States Congress and the
President to reduce defense spending while maintaining federal programs which invest in the infrastructure and people of the community.
Whereas, no area in this country
will remain prosperous unless the
resources available to the federal
government are invested in the
infrastructure and people of the
cities; and
Whereas,
the
United
States
National Security Committee on May
1, 1996 voted to give the Pentagon
$13 billion more than the $254 billion requested by President Clinton
for fiscal year 1997, most of it for a
new weapons system, and all of this
extra $13 billion is at the expense
of environmental, job training, housing, education and mass transit programs; and
Whereas, Council, as leaders of
the City of Cleveland, urge prompt
action by the President and members of Congress on a non-partisan
basis to stop borrowing from our
children and begin investing in the
future, and we also urge a commitment to swift action on a fair and
balanced budget that calls for all
Americans to make shared sacrifices; and
Whereas, to enact a balanced
plan, there must be these shared
sacrifices by the American people to
achieve fair and balanced deficit
elimination, and all parts of the federal
budget,
including
defense
spending, must be on the table; and
Whereas, there can be no sacred
cows in the process because there
can be no equity if only half the
federal budget is subject to deficit
reduction; it is inequitable for the
federal government to ask those
with the least, including the elderly at risk, to pay a disproportionately high share to balance years of
federal deficits and it is inequitable
to provide new tax breaks until
there is a clearly defined achievement, to which all Americans contribute, to reduce the deficit and
national debt; and
Whereas, we, both community
leaders and community residents,
are stewards of the futures of our
communities and therefore bear a
high responsibility to ensure that
every child has an opportunity to
succeed and has a future unburdened of today’s debts; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges all members of the United
States Congress and the President
of the United States to, when considering federal budget resolutions,
reduce defense spending and maintain environmental, job training,
housing, education, mass transit and
other programs which invest in the
infrastructure and people of the
country.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit copies of this resolution to
the Northeast Ohio delegates of the
United States Congress, to Senators
John Glenn and Mike DeWine, to
the Senate Majority Leader, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and
to President Bill Clinton.

Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 1625-96.
By
CouncilmanPaulenske
(by
request).
An emergency resolution declaring the intention to vacate a portion
of King Court N.E.
Whereas, this Council is satisfied
that there is good cause for vacating a portion of King Court N.E., as
hereinafter described, and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it hereby declares
its intention to vacate: The following described real property, located
in
Cleveland,
Cuyahoga
County,
Ohio, and known as being all that
portion of:
KING COURT N.E. (16.5 feet
wide), extending Easterly from the
Easterly line of East 33rd Street
(66.00 feet wide), to the Westerly
line of East 38th Street (99.00 feet
wide).
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Public
Service, City Planning Commission,
Finance, Law; Committees on Public Service, City Planning, Finance.
Res. No. 1626-96.
By Councilman Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to enact
legislation
which
will
prohibit
states and political subdivisions
from granting corporate tax abatement and to enact, as an alternative, programs and incentives to
encourage corporations to relocate
in areas with slum and blight conditions and high unemployment levels.
Whereas, many states have enacted laws which attempt to encourage
corporations to locate in inner-city
neighborhoods with high unemployment rates by means of offering corporate tax abatement; and
Whereas, these laws have been
passed in the anticipation that
employers would have an incentive
to
adapt
outmoded
buildings,
improve inferior infrastructure and
hire from the local population and
help drive-down unemployment; and
Whereas, the reality of the use of
corporate tax abatement has been
very different than anticipated; and
Whereas, often these laws extend
tax abatements to suburbs and rural
areas with the result that tax abatements are no longer used only in
declining cities; and
Whereas, these laws have enabled
states and municipalities that do

1750

September 11, 1996
not have large concentrations of
poor and unemployed persons residing within their borders to attract
businesses from states and municipalities which are economically disadvantaged; and
Whereas, corporate tax abatement
shifts the property tax burden from
abated corporations to non-abated
small taxpayers, which means that
long-term businesses will be paying
a larger share of the property tax
burden; and
Whereas, corporate tax abatement
undercuts a local government's ability to provide basic services like
education and public infrastructure;
and
Whereas, by giving away property taxes on which public schools
depend, cities almost guarantee to
weaken the resource base for the
schools, thereby weakening a key
element which encourages business
location; and
Whereas, corporate tax abatement
pits city against city and state
against state, to the detriment of
all; and
Whereas, there are alternatives to
corporate
tax
abatement
which
cities and states can invest in to
benefit
inner-city
neighborhoods,
such as worker training programs
and grants offered to corporations
who are willing to clean-up “brownfields” in order to relocate to areas
with slum and blight conditions;
and
Whereas, since residential tax
abatement
helps
restore
urban
areas, this Council emphasizes that
it is only opposed to the continued
availability of corporate tax abatement as provided in existing state
law and supports the continued
availability of residential tax abatement; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that corporate
tax abatement is a tragic game
where the only winners are the corporations, with the school systems,
municipalities and states numbered
among the losers; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the members of the United States Congress to enact legislation which will prohibit states and
political subdivisions from granting
corporate tax abatement.
Section 2. That this Council hereby further urges the United States
Congress to enact, as an alternative
to corporate tax abatement, programs and incentives to encourage
corporations to relocate in areas
with slum and blight conditions and
high unemployment levels.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the President of the U.S. Senate, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the members of the Congressional
delegation
from
the
Greater Cleveland area.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Pursuant to the authority vested
in the Director of Equal Opportunity (“Director”) by the Council of the
City of Cleveland (“City”) under
Section 123.08 and Chapter 187 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, 1976 (the “Code”), the
Director hereby revises, promulgates and orders published in the
City Record the following rules and
regulations (“Regulations”). They
are effective as of and from July 1,
1996.
I. INTRODUCTION
The
Minority
Business
and
Female
Business
Enterprise
(“MBE/FBE”) Code, Chapter 187 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended, was
enacted originally and continues to
be necessary to remedy the effects
of past and present discrimination
in the City’s contracting market.
The purpose of the Code is to
increase the utilization of minorities
and females in City contracting to
a proportion more representative of
their presence in the City’s contracting market both by increasing
MBE/FBE participation in City contracts and by encouraging affirmative actions by all parties who contract with the City to employ persons and treat employees during
employment without regard to race,
sex, religion, color, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability,
ethnic group or Vietnam-era or disabled veteran status. The following
standards, rules, regulations and
procedures implement the City’s
MBE/FBE Code.

II. DEFINITIONS
2.01 All words, phrases and terms
used in these Regulations shall
have the same definitions as contained in Section 187.01 of the Code
or if not therein defined, as defined
in this Part II or as the context
requires.
2.02 “Affirmative action” means
taking and includes specific steps
intended to eliminate discrimination
and its effects and to ensure nondiscriminatory practices in the future.
2.03 “Concession agreement”, in
addition to the definitions in Sections 183.04 and 183.041 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976, includes a lease by way of concession which grants the privilege
of vending commodities or rendering services to the public upon or
in publicly owned facilities.
2.04 “Minority” means a person
who is a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States
and who is:
(a) Black, i.e., a person having
origins in any of the black racial
groups of Africa; or
(b) Hispanic, i.e., a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central
or South American, or other Hispanic culture or origin, regardless
of race; or
(c) Asian-Indian, i.e., a person
having origins in any of the original peoples of the Indian subcontinent; or

having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, southeast Asia, or the Pacific Islands; or
(e) Native American, i.e., a person
having origins in any of the original peoples of the continental United States.
2.05 “OEO” means the Office of
Equal Opportunity of the City of
Cleveland.
2.06 A “Set-aside” is a technique in
which consideration for award of a
contract is limited to bids or proposals submitted by MBEs and
FBEs.
III. MBE/FBE UTILIZATION
3.01 Certification Process
(a) Any business enterprise seeking recognition as an MBE or FBE
for purposes of the Code and these
Regulations must have certification
by OEO as a bona fide minority or
female business enterprise prior to
submitting a bid or proposal for a
contract.
(b) For purposes of the Code and
these Regulations, any contractor
proposing to subcontract work to
MBEs or FBEs in the performance
of a contract must ascertain that
the MBEs and FBEs have been certified by OEO as bona fide minority or female business enterprises
prior to submitting a bid or proposal for a contract.
(c) Each applicant for certification as an MBE or FBE must complete and submit an application to
OEO on a form approved by the
Director and provided by OEO. In

1762

September 11, 1996
the application, the applicant must
identify the specific type(s) of work
it has performed for at least one
year prior to the application for certification. Each application must be
legibly printed or typewritten and
the signatures of the owner(s) of
the business enterprise notarized,
and accompanied by an affidavit on
a form approved by the Director and
provided by OEO, verifying the
truth and accuracy of the information supplied in the application, and
by copies of all documents requested in the application. OEO shall
have the right to request additional
information or to visit site(s) relevant to the application as part of
the certification process. An Administrator may require the applicant to
submit records, including any tax
returns, for the Administrator’s consideration in determining whether
to certify the applicant. Failure to
submit these records upon request
will result in a denial of the application for certification. The Administrator and OEO shall protect the
confidentiality of tax returns and
any information or records which
the applicant identifies as proprietary information or trade secret, in
accordance with law.
(d) An Administrator will base
any recommendation to the Director
whether to certify an applicant as
an MBE or FBE on the factors
delineated in Section 3.02 of these
Regulations, as verified in the application and documentation submitted. An applicant will be notified in
writing of the action of the Director on its application. If the Director determines that the applicant
should be certified as an MBE or
FBE, a certificate will accompany
the notice of determination by OEO.
In the event of an adverse determination by the Director, an applicant
may request a conference in accordance with division (j) of this Section 3.01.
(e) Certification as an MBE or
FBE in accordance with this Section
3.01 shall be effective for a period
of one year from the date of the
determination
by
the
Director,
unless the certification is withdrawn sooner in accordance with
Part VI of these Regulations.
(f) In order to add to the type(s)
of work performed listed on an MBE
or FBE’s certificate, the certificateholder must make a written request
to the appropriate Administrator to
amend its certificate to reflect such
additional type(s) of work. The
request should contain information
sufficient for OEO to verify that the
MBE or FBE has performed the new
type of work for a period of at least
one (1) year prior to the date of the
request. If, based upon the recommendation of the Administrator, the
Director determines to include the
new type of work on the certificate
of the MBE or FBE, an amended
certificate will be issued with the
written notice of determination by
OEO. If the Director determines not
to grant any or all of the request,
the certificateholder may request a
conference in the same manner prescribed on division (j) of this Section
3.01.
Amendments
to
the
descriptions of the type of work on
a certificate will not affect the expiration date of the certificate.
(g) All requests for recertification
must be on a form approved by the
Director and provided by OEO. The

September 11, 1996

The City Record

completed recertification form will
not be accepted unless the responses are legibly printed or typewritten and the signature(s) of the
owner(s) of the business enterprise
are notarized. In order to avoid a
lapse in certification, all requests
for recertification must be received
at least thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the certification.

nership, at least fifty-one percent
(51%) of each class of partnership
interest is owned by minorities or
females; that such owners have control of the management and day-today operations of the business; and
that such owners have an interest
in the capital, assets, profits and
losses of the business proportionate
to their percentage of ownership;

(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of division (g) of this Section
3.01, no later than five (5) years
from the initial certification date of
a business enterprise as an MBE or
FBE and every fifth (5th) year
thereafter, a business enterprise
that has remained continuously certified by OEO as an MBE or FBE
must submit an application for certification on the form referenced in
division (c) of this Section 3.01 and
in the same manner as a business
enterprise first applying for MBE or
FBE certification.

(3) If the MBE or FBE is a sole
proprietorship, the proprietor is a
minority or female; that such owner
has control over the management
and day-to-day operations of the
business; and that such owner has
the entire interest in the capital,
assets, profits and losses of the
business, not including mortgages
and
other
types
of
financial
arrangements secured by assets;

(i)
Each
certificateholder
is
responsible to initiate its recertification process. The failure of the
certificateholder to apply for recertification by the annual anniversary
date will result in the expiration of
the certificate.
(j) An applicant may request a
conference with the Director on a
denial of an application for certification or recertification by depositing the request in the U.S. mail
within five (5) business days of
receipt of the denial. After considering the information supplied by
the applicant at the conference,
reviewing the file and such additional information as the Director
may require or request, and determining that a certificate should
have been issued, the Director may
issue the appropriate certificate. If,
following the conference, the Director determines that the certificate
was properly denied, the applicant
will be notified in writing of such
determination.
(k) An applicant denied MBE or
FBE certification may not reapply
for certification for a period of six
(6) months after the date of the
final determination by the Director.
3.02 Factors Considered in Certification of MBEs and FBEs
(a) In order to demonstrate that
a business enterprise applying for
certification as an MBE or FBE is
“owned, operated, and controlled” by
one or more females or minorities,
the applicant for certification must
submit information and documentation sufficient in the sole judgment
of an Administrator to demonstrate
that:
(1) If the MBE or FBE is a corporation, at least fifty-one percent
(51%) of each class of corporate
voting stock is owned by minorities
or females; that at least fifty-one
percent (51%) of the members of
the board of directors and fifty-one
percent (51%) of the principal executive officers of the corporation are
minorities or females; and that the
rights of any stock class to control
the
management
and
day-to-day
operations of the business and the
interest of any stock class in the
capital, assets, profits and losses of
the business are proportionate to
the stock ownership of that class;
(2) If the MBE or FBE is a part-

(4) If the MBE or FBE is a certified joint venture, at least fiftyone percent (51%) of the joint venture is controlled by a certified
MBE or FBE; that the owner(s) of
the certified MBE or FBE co-venturer control the management and
day-to-day operations of the certified joint venture; and that such
persons have an interest in the capital, assets, profits and losses of the
certified joint venture proportionate
to their percentage of control;
(5) While part ownership of a
business enterprise by non-minority
or non-female persons may be necessary to ensure adequate capital
and management for the business
enterprise’s development, any property, equipment, supplies, services
and/or financial assistance which
are sold, rented or donated to the
MBE or FBE by the non-minority or
non-female owners must be reported
to OEO annually;
(6) For the purpose of MBE certification, the owner or operator
identifies himself or herself to the
public as a member of the claimed
minority group;
(7) The females or minorities who
own the majority interest in the
business enterprise have maintained
control of the business enterprise
proportionate to their ownership
interest in the enterprise for at least
one year immediately preceding the
application date, including but not
limited to, exercising the power to
make significant policy and management decisions for the business
enterprise, deciding how contracts
will be performed by the business
enterprise, organizing and controlling the finances of the business
enterprise
and
supervising
the
employees
and/or
subcontractors
who will be performing the contractual obligations of the business
enterprise;
(8) The females or minorities who
own the majority interest in the
business enterprise enjoy incidents
of ownership customary in or to
such business entities; and
(9) The ownership, management
and control of the business enterprise by the females or minorities
are real and substantial and exist
in fact and not merely as statements in the official documents of
the business enterprise.
(b) Among the factors that OEO
will consider in evaluating the actual control of the day-to-day operations of the MBE or FBE are:

1763

51
(1) Previous or current employment of the minority or female
owner(s) by the non-minority or
non-female owners or managers of
the business enterprise;
(2) Affiliation of the non-minority
or non-female owner(s) or manager(s) with another business enterprise in the same or similar type of
business as the applicant for MBE
or FBE certification;
(3) Exercise by the non-minority
or non-female owner(s) or manager(s) of final authority over any
aspect of the day-to-day operations,
management or control of the business enterprise;
(4) Whether control of the operations of the business enterprise by
the
non-minority
or
non-female
owner(s) or manager(s) directly or
indirectly restricts the economic
growth of the business enterprise;
(5) Possession by the minority or
female owner(s) of management
abilities sufficient to exercise effective control of the business;
(6) The compensation received by
the
non-minority
or
non-female
owner(s) or manager(s) in relation
to the compensation received by the
minority or female owner(s) or
manager(s); and
(7) Whether non-minority or nonfemale stockholders, officers, directors or employees of the business
enterprise exercise actual, ultimate
control or have the authority to
exercise such control over any
aspect of the day-to-day operations,
finances or management decisions
and policies of the business enterprise.
(c) All applicants for certification
as an MBE or FBE must use when
applying for fields of work listing,
business
classifications
and/or
types of work which are consistent
with current industry standards,
and to substantiate such listing
must:
(1) Possess all licenses, permits
and authorities required by law, to
perform the types of work within
each classification requested; and
(2) Demonstrate capability and/or
experience within those classifications for a period of one year immediately prior to the date of application for certification.
(d) Each applicant seeking certification as an MBE or FBE shall
demonstrate that it has and will
perform
a
“commercially
useful
function” in the conduct of its business with respect to prior contracts
and the contract bid by information
documentation submitted with its
application. Such information shall
substantiate that the business enterprise is directly responsible for providing materials, equipment, and
supplies and is executing a distinct
element of the work required by the
solicitation for bids or request for
proposals by actually performing,
managing, and/or supervising the
work involved through its own
employees or principals and not
through independent contractors. In
determining whether a business
enterprise is performing a commercially useful function, the City may
also consider the dollar proportion
of the contractor’s work which is

52
subcontracted, industry practices,
and other relevant factors.
(e) Each applicant for certification as an MBE or FBE must be
located and doing business in the
Cleveland contracting market. In
order to demonstrate that a business
enterprise is “located and doing
business” in the Cleveland contracting market, the applicant for certification must submit information
and documentation sufficient in the
sole discretion of an Administrator
to demonstrate that:
(1) The business enterprise either
owns or leases an office or operating space located in the Cleveland
contracting market from which it
will conduct its business throughout
the period of certification as an
MBE or FBE;
(2) If the business enterprise leases but does not own an office or
operating space within the Cleveland contracting market, the term of
at least one such lease must extend
beyond one year after the date of
the application for certification;
(f) A business enterprise will not
be certified as an MBE or FBE if:
(1)
The
female
or
minority
owner(s) and managers of the business enterprise are not responsible
for the management, operation or
control of the business enterprise in
direct proportion to their ownership
interest in the enterprise.
(2) More than fifty percent (50%)
of the contractual obligations of the
business enterprise are regularly
performed by non-FBE or non-MBE
subcontractors.
(3) The business enterprise is not
performing a “commercially useful
function” in the performance of its
contractual obligations, as defined
in division (d) of this Section 3.02.
(4) The business enterprise is not
located and doing business in the
Cleveland contracting market.
3.03 Joint Ventures: Certification
and Appeal Process
(a) A joint venture is a contractual relationship for profit between
two or more business enterprises
which have joined together by
means of a written agreement to
supply a specified service for a particular contract or accomplish a specific project. The joint venture
application must identify the project(s) or service(s) for which the
joint venture was created and specify project length, responsibilities
and profit and loss division.
(b) Participation of MBEs and
FBEs in joint ventures is encouraged. In order to be certified as a
joint venture for purposes of the
Code and these Regulations, and in
addition to demonstrating that the
minority or female business co-venturer is certified as an MBE or FBE
pursuant to Section 3.02 of these
Regulations, the applicant must
demonstrate that there is a community of interest among the co-venturers as to the purpose of the
undertaking, and that each co-venturer stands in the relation of principal as well as agent to each of the
other co-venturers, with a right of
control of the means employed to
carry out the common purpose of

The City Record
the venture and a fiduciary duty
toward the joint venture. The MBE
or FBE co-venturer must have a
right of control of and a fiduciary
duty toward the joint venture and
must be responsible for performance
of a clearly-defined portion of the
work to be performed, of equal proportion to its share in the ownership, control, management, responsibility, risks, and profits and losses
of the joint venture.
(c) A joint venture is eligible to
be certified by OEO if:
(1) One or more co-venturers in
the joint venture is certified by OEO
as an MBE or an FBE; and
(2) The MBE or FBE co-venturer
has at least fifty-one percent (51%)
interest in the ownership and control of the joint venture; and
(3) The MBE or FBE co-venturer
with its own workforce, performs
work totaling 51% or more of the
contract cost of the items to be performed by the co-venturers; and
(4) The MBE or FBE co-venturer
has the ability to meet any qualifications identified in the bid with
respect to the performance of the
work equal to or in excess of its
respective share of the joint venture; and
(5) The joint venture has submitted to OEO a notarized application
for approval at least ten (10) business days prior to the bid opening
date for the project for which the
joint venture seeks a contract. The
application must be provided on a
form provided by OEO and must
reflect compliance with this Section
3.03 and state the specific tasks to
be performed by each participant in
the joint venture. The applicant
must furnish with the application a
complete, fully-executed copy of the
joint
venture
agreement
which
delineates the rights, obligations,
and scope of work of the co-venturers, together with copies of the OEO
certification of any MBE or FBE
party to the joint venture and a
summary sheet setting forth the following:
A. the purpose for which the joint
venture was created;
B. the names of the co-venturers;
C. the place of business of the
joint venture;
D. the rights of the respective coventurers and the division of management
responsibilities
between
the co-venturers;
E. the contribution of capital to
the joint venture provided by each
co-venturer;
F. the allocation and distribution
of profits and losses between the coventurers;
G. evidence of insurance and of a
joint bank account for the joint venture; and
H. the procedures to be followed
with respect to the termination of
the joint venture.
Each application must be accompanied by a sworn affidavit verify-

1764

September 11, 1996
ing the truth and accuracy of the
information supplied in the application; and
(6) The principal(s) of each coventurer meet with an Administrator prior to the bid opening date to
discuss the application of the joint
venture to be certified by OEO.
(d) Applicants shall obtain certification by OEO of any joint venture identified in a bid prior to submitting a bid or proposal. If the
application for certification is not
received in sufficient time for OEO
to complete review of the application prior to submission of a bid or
proposal by the joint venture and
the joint venture is denied certification, the denial may result in
rejection of the bid or proposal. No
substitution of co-venturers in a
joint venture agreement may be
made after a bid or proposal from
the joint venture is under consideration by the City.
(e) If a co-venturer is certified as
an MBE or FBE by OEO and the
applicant has demonstrated that the
joint venture meets the criteria
delineated in this Section 3.03, an
Administrator will recommend to
the Director to certify the applicant
as an MBE or FBE joint venture.
An applicant will be notified in
writing of the determination of the
Director. If the Director determines
that the applicant should be certified as an MBE or FBE joint venture, a written certification will
accompany the notice of determination. In the event of an adverse
determination by the Director, an
applicant may request a conference
in accordance with division (g) of
this Section 3.03.
(f) For the purpose of submitting
bids or proposals for contracts and
of performing work as a subcontractor, certification of an MBE or
FBE joint venture is effective for
the shorter of three (3) months or
so long as the joint venture agreement remains unchanged and in
effect, all of the MBE or FBE coventurers remain certified by OEO,
and the certification is not invalidated pursuant to Part VI of these
Regulations. Certified MBE or FBE
joint ventures must submit with
their bids or proposals an affidavit
on a form supplied by OEO that the
provisions of the joint venture
agreement remain unchanged and
in effect. Notwithstanding any provision of this division (f) to the contrary, an OEO-certified MBE or FBE
joint venture will remain certified
throughout the performance of the
contract or subcontract for which it
was certified, provided the joint
venture
agreement
remains
unchanged and in effect, all of the
MBE or FBE co-venturers remain
certified by OEO and the certification is not withdrawn in accordance
with Part VI of these Regulations.
(g) An applicant may request a
conference with the Director on a
denial of an application for certification as a joint venture by depositing the request in the U.S. mail
within five (5) business days of
receipt of denial. After considering
the information supplied by the
applicant at the conference, reviewing the file and such additional
information as the Director may
require or request, and determining
that a certificate should have been
issued, the Director may issue the

September 11, 1996
appropriate certificate. If, following
the conference, the Director determines that the certificate was properly denied, the applicant will be
notified in writing of such determination.
(h) In order to be considered an
MBE or FBE prime contractor for
purposes
of
evaluating
bids
in
accordance with Section 3.06 of
these Regulations, MBE or FBE
joint venturers must be certified in
accordance with Section 3.03 prior to
submission of the bid. Only that portion of the dollar value of the contract equal to the percentage of participation of the MBE or FBE coventurer in the joint venture may be
applied toward meeting either the
annual City-wide goal for each contracting department or the goals for
a particular contract fixed in accordance with Section 3.04.
3.04 Goals for MBE/FBE Utilization in Contracts
(a) In furtherance of the City’s
goal of removing the effects of past
and present discrimination against
MBEs and FBEs in the performance
of
contracts,
each
contracting
department of the City will use its
best efforts to utilize MBEs and
FBEs as contractors or subcontractors for all contracts.
(b) The goals for MBE and FBE
participation in each particular contract shall be fixed as follows:
(1) On or before January 1st of
each year, the Director shall fix and
furnish to each contracting department
the
appropriate
City-wide
goals for MBE and FBE participation for each type of contract and
for each type of work to be performed in a contract, based upon the
availability of certified MBEs and
FBEs in the Cleveland contracting
market and within the range of
annual goals fixed by the City
Council in Section 187.03 of the
Code. During each year, the Director may change the City-wide goals
fixed pursuant to this division (b)
(1)
as
a
result
of
significant
changes in the availability of certified MBEs or FBEs in the Cleveland
contracting market to perform certain types of contracts or certain
types of work in the performance of
contracts. The Director shall furnish
each contracting department any
changes to the City-wide goals
which occur during the year and the
effective date of the change.
(2) By February 1st of each year,
each contracting department shall
submit a report to OEO identifying
the efforts utilized by the contracting department to meet the annual
City-wide goals for MBE and FBE
participation in contracts during the
preceding year and setting forth a
general plan identifying specific
actions it will take to meet the
annual City-wide goals for MBE and
FBE participation in contracts during the current year. OEO will provide each contracting department
with a format for the report, including any specific information which
must be supplied.
(3) At least five (5) business days
prior to advertising for bids or proposals for a particular contract,
each contracting department shall
identify to OEO the type of contract
and the type(s) of work to be bid.
In addition, if more than one type

The City Record
of work is to be performed in the
contract, the contracting department
shall provide OEO with an estimate
of the percentage of the total work
which is each type of work. The
Director or the Director’s designee,
in consultation with the contracting
department, shall fix the goals for
MBE and FBE participation in the
particular contract based upon the
contracting department’s report, the
annual City-wide goals determined
by the Director in accordance with
division (b) (1) of this Section 3.04
and the availability of certified
MBEs or FBEs in the Cleveland contracting market to perform any or
all of the type(s) of work in the
contract. The goal for a particular
contract may exceed the range of
goals fixed by the City Council in
Section 187.03 of the Code for the
purpose of assisting the contracting
department in meeting the annual
City-wide goal for the type of contract to be awarded.
(4) The contracting department
shall submit for inclusion the goals
for a particular contract fixed in
accordance with division (b) (3) of
this Section 3.04 in the bid invitation and specifications or request
for proposal for the particular contract.
(c) Only expenditures to certified
MBEs and FBEs that perform a
“commercially useful function” in
the implementation or performance
of a contract, as defined in division
(d) of Section 3.02 of these Regulations, may be counted toward meeting either the annual City-wide
goals for each contracting department or the goals for a particular
contract.
(d) FBE goals fixed for a particular contract are in addition to and
separate from the MBE goals fixed
in that contract. A contractor or subcontractor who qualifies as both an
MBE and FBE may obtain certification as both. The total dollar
value of a particular contract attributable to an MBE or FBE may be
applied to either the MBE goal or
the FBE goal, but not to both. The
contractor must elect the category
to which the contract value should
be applied.
(e) In the case of a certified MBE
or FBE joint venture, only that portion of the total dollar amount of
the contract with the joint venture
equal to the percentage of participation of the minority or female
business enterprise in the joint venture may be applied toward meeting
either the annual City-wide goals
for each contracting department or
the goals for a particular contract.
The work to be performed by the
MBE or FBE co-venturer in a certified joint venture may not be
applied toward meeting the goals
fixed for a particular contract for
MBE and FBE subcontractor participation.
(f) The entire amount of expenditures to a certified MBE or FBE
manufacturer (i.e., an enterprise
that produces goods from raw materials or adds value by substantially
altering them before resale) may be
applied toward meeting either the
annual City-wide goals for each contracting department or the goals for
a particular contract. Only twenty
percent (20%) of expenditures to
certified MBE or FBE suppliers that
are
not
manufacturers
may
be

1765

53
counted toward meeting either the
annual City-wide goals for each contracting department or the goals for
a particular contract, provided that
the MBE or FBE supplier performs
a “commercially useful function in
the supply process.” A business
enterprise is a supplier performing
a “commercially useful function in
the supply process” when it:
(1) assumes the actual and contractual responsibility for furnishing the supplies or materials; and
(2) is recognized as a supplier,
distributor or reseller by the manufacturer or producer of the contracted supplies and materials; and
(3) owns or leases a warehouse,
yard, building, or other facilities or
uses such means as are customary
in the industry for the purpose of
maintaining an inventory of or supplying such supplies or materials
from which it supplies its customers; and
(4) distributes, delivers, and/or
services products primarily with its
own staff and/or equipment.
(g) If an MBE or FBE supplier is
not a manufacturer and is not performing
a
“commercially
useful
function in the supply process,” no
expenditure to it may be counted
toward meeting any goals.
(h) If an MBE or FBE subcontractor further subcontracts work or
services to be performed under the
contract to non-MBEs and non-FBEs,
the contract amount attributable to
the non-MBE or non-FBE subcontract shall not apply toward either
the annual City-wide goals for each
contracting department or the goals
for a particular contract. This provision does not apply to a subcontractor’s contracts for the purchase
of materials, equipment, or supplies
for its own use or incidental to the
performance of services under the
contract.
3.05 MBE/FBE Utilization in City
Contracts
(a) Contracting departments shall
consider
utilization
of
certified
MBEs and FBEs when recommending a lowest and best or lowest
responsible bid or a proposal for a
contract. In order to enable contracting departments to consider
MBE and FBE utilization in determining the lowest and best or lowest responsible bidder or accepting
a proposal, a bidder, including an
MBE or FBE contractor or a MBE
or FBE joint venture, must document as required by OEO the bidder’s efforts to utilize MBE and
FBE subcontractors in a percentage
equal to the MBE and FBE goals
for the particular contract. A bidder’s
failure
to
document
such
efforts may result in the rejection
of its bid or proposal.
(b) In determining whether a bidder has demonstrated good faith in
meeting goals for utilization of
MBEs and FBEs in the performance
of a particular contract, OEO will
consider the following:
(1) the total amount of the work
available to be performed by subcontractors;
(2) the availability of certified
MBEs and FBEs to perform work

The City Record

54
which may
contractors;

be

performed

by

sub-

(3) the work experience of the
certified MBEs and FBEs named by
the bidder in the OEO schedules;
(4) the total amount of work
which the bidder proposes to subcontract to certified MBEs and
FBEs;
(5) the type(s) of work that the
bidder traditionally either subcontracts or performs with its own
employees;
(6)
the
documented
methods
employed by the bidder to contact
certified MBEs and FBEs to perform work;
(7) whether the certified MBEs
and FBEs identified in the bid are
listed by OEO for the type of work
identified in the bid;
(8) whether the OEO schedules
submitted by the MBE and FBE subcontractors are consistent with the
OEO schedules submitted by the bidder;
(9) whether the work to be performed by the MBE or FBE may
apply, wholly or partially, to any
MBE or FBE goals under these Regulations;
(10) whether MBE and FBE subcontractors re-subcontract any of
their work to non-MBEs or nonFBEs;
(11) whether the bidder or any of
the identified MBEs or FBEs have
previously
violated
the
City’s
MBE/FBE Code; and
(12) whether the bidder has historically performed the work by its
own forces and intends to continue
this practice for the particular contract.
(c) All bid invitations, requests
for proposals and specifications for
contracts must contain accurate and
complete OEO schedules on forms
prescribed by OEO. A bidder shall
submit
the
completed
schedules
with its bid; a proposer shall submit
the completed schedules with its
proposal or by such later time as
specifically
prescribed
in
the
request for proposals. Failure to furnish all the applicable information
requested on the schedules will
result in a disqualification of the
bid or proposal.
(d) A bidder’s compliance with
the requirements of the Code and
these Regulations will be determined solely on the basis of the
information supplied by the bidder
or proposer in its completed schedules. There shall be no communication between OEO and the bidder
while the bids are pending.
(e) Each bidder shall identify all
MBE/FBE subcontractors and coventurers in its bid or proposal.
Only that portion of the dollar value
of the contract equal to the portion
of the participation of a certified
MBE,
a
certified
FBE,
or
a
MBE/FBE co-venturer in a certified
joint venture may apply toward
meeting the City’s goals. The work
to be performed by the MBE or FBE
co-venturer
shall
apply
toward

meeting the goals fixed for a particular contract for MBE and FBE
subcontractor participation.
(f) Each bidder shall identify in
its bid or proposal all MBE or FBE
subcontractors and co-venturers that
are manufacturers or suppliers. The
amount
of
expenditures
to
MBE/FBE manufacturers or suppliers which will apply toward meeting the MBE and FBE goals fixed
for a particular contract shall be
determined in accordance with division (f) of Section 3.04 of these Regulations.
(g) Each bidder shall identify in
its bid or proposal if an MBE or
FBE subcontractor further subcontracts any work or services to be
performed under the contract to nonminority business enterprises and
non-female
business
enterprises.
The contract amount re-subcontracted to a non-MBE or non-FBE shall
not be apply toward meeting the
MBE or FBE goals for the particular contract, except in the case of a
subcontractor’s contracts for the
purchase of materials, equipment or
supplies which are merely incidental to the performance of services
under the contract.
(h) For the purpose of reporting
the specific field or type of work to
be subcontracted, the bidder must
describe on the OEO schedules the
specific distinct work or discrete
portion of the total project work
which each MBE or FBE subcontractor will perform. Appropriate,
acceptable descriptions include, for
example, “masonry,” “steel erection,”
“electrical,” “plumbing,” etc. The bidder shall not use general, non-specific terms such as “general contractor,” “general contracting” or
“labor and materials” when describing the work.
(i) Except as provided in divisions (j) and (k) of this Section
3.05, modification of OEO forms or
substitution of new MBE/FBE subcontractors or co-venturers will not
be permitted between the time that
bids are submitted and a contract is
awarded.
(j) If, between the time the bid or
proposal is submitted and a contract
is awarded, a certified MBE or FBE
subcontractor identified in the bid
or proposal wishes to withdraw
from participation in the contract,
the bidder shall submit an affidavit
from an authorized representative
of the certified MBE or FBE subcontractor stating the reason(s) for
the withdrawal and proposing a certified MBE or FBE as a substitute.
The affidavit must be in a form
acceptable to the Director and be
signed by an authorized representative of the certified MBE or FBE
subcontractor. If, in the sole opinion
of the Director, the reason(s) for
withdrawal stated in the affidavit is
beyond the influence and control of
the bidder, then the bidder may substitute new, certified MBE or FBE
subcontractor for the withdrawing
subcontractor. Although the participation of the substitute certified
MBE or FBE subcontractor may
apply toward meeting the applicable
MBE or FBE goal for the particular
contract, it will not increase the
total percentage of MBE or FBE
participation offered by the bidder
in its bid. The submission of false
or misleading information in the
affidavit submitted pursuant to this

1766

September 11, 1996
division (j) will result in a finding
of noncompliance by the Administrator in accordance with division
(a) of Part VI of these Regulations.
(k) If, after a bid is submitted but
before a contract is awarded, the
City disqualifies an MBE or FBE
subcontractor
proposed
in
good
faith in a bid through no fault of
the bidder, the bidder may propose
a substitute certified MBE or FBE,
as appropriate. If the Director has
no objection to such proposed MBE
or FBE subcontractor, the bidder
may substitute it for the disqualified MBE or FBE under like conditions as in division (j) of this Section 3.05.
(l) Contracting departments shall
invite a representative of OEO to
each pre-bid conference to assist the
bidders in properly complying with
the requirements of the Code and
these Regulations.
(m) Upon request, OEO will identify all certified MBEs and/or certified FBEs known to OEO to be in
a specified trade, craft, profession
or field of expertise at the time of
the request. The furnishing of a list
of certified contractors is intended
only to identify holders of MBE,
FBE, or MBE/FBE joint venture
certifications by OEO. By identification or certification, the City
makes no representations as to the
quality of the work or services by
the named MBEs or FBEs, nor does
it guarantee any materials supplied
or work or services to be performed
by the listed MBEs or FBEs.
(n) If a bid invitation or request
for
proposal
contains
alternate
items for bid or proposal, the percentage of MBE and FBE participation will be determined with reference to the total dollar amount of
the base bid and any alternates to
be awarded. For this reason, each
bidder shall submit separate OEO
schedules for the base bid and for
each alternate item identified in the
bid specifications.
(o) After approval of a contract
by the Board of Control but prior to
execution of the contract, the successful bidder must submit to OEO:
(1) Copies of executed agreements with the MBE and FBE subcontractors identified in its bid.
Each agreement shall, at a minimum, specify the dollar value of the
participation by the subcontractor
and the type of work to be performed by the subcontractor;
(2) A complete list of all non-MBE
or non-FBE subcontractors to be
used by the successful bidder in the
performance of the contract, the
type of work or discrete portion of
the project work to be performed by
each subcontractor and an estimate
of the total contract amount to be
paid to each subcontractor. Each
subcontractor must be approved by
the Board of Control prior to commencement of any work on the project by the subcontractor; and
(3) A time schedule for the performance of the contract, including,
but not limited to, the approximate
dates on which the subcontractors
will be working at the job site.
Prior to using any additional subcontractor(s) in the performance of
the contract, the contractor shall

September 11, 1996
provide OEO with a supplement to
the submissions required in divisions (o) (1), (o) (2), and (o) (3)
of this Section 3.05 as it pertains to
the work to be performed by additional subcontractor(s).
(p) In order to fulfill the purposes of the Code, contractors must use
MBEs and FBEs in ways which preserve and promote meaningful ownership, control and performance of
the work or other contract obligations by the MBE or FBE. Failure
to do so may subject the contractor
to criminal prosecution, decertification, and other sanctions.
3.06 Evaluation of Bids
(a) If the bid of any prime bidder which is an MBE, FBE or an
MBE or FBE joint venture does not
exceed the lowest actual bid by
more than five percent (5%), the
contracting department may elect to
award the contract to the MBE,
FBE or MBE/FBE joint venture. If
more than one MBE or FBE prime
contractor submits a which does not
exceed the lowest actual bid by
more than five percent (5%), the
contracting department may determine the successful
MBE or FBE
bidder by applying the bid adjustment factor set forth in division (b)
of this Section 3.06.
(b) Except as provided in division
(a) of this Section 3.06, the City will
consider MBE and FBE subcontractor/supplier utilization a factor in
determining the lowest and best or
lowest responsible bid or in accepting a proposal for a contract by
computing a Comparison Bid. The
Comparison Bid for a bidder shall
be the product of its total actual bid
times that adjustment factor from
the scales in the applicable Appendices A through E attached to these
Regulations which correlates to the
total MBE and FBE utilization by
the bidder. That is,
Comparison Bid=Actual Bid x Minority
Bid Adjustment Factor
A lower MBE or FBE participation will result in a higher comparison bid.
(c) The comparison bid amount
determined in accordance with this
Section 3.06 will be used for evaluation purposes only; contracts will
be awarded at the actual bid prices.
3.07 Shifting of Work: Exceptions;
Substitutions; Waivers
(a) Shifting. The shifting of work
or services from MBE/FBE subcontractors to non-MBE and non-FBE
subcontractors or the reduction or
elimination of work identified in a
bid to be performed by MBEs and
FBEs is prohibited without: 1) written verification from the bidder or
prime contractor that the subcontractor identified in the bid cannot
perform
due
to
circumstances
beyond the influence and control of
the bidder or prime contractor and,
if applicable, a detailed written
explanation of circumstances that
support reduction or elimination of
MBEs and FBEs in the performance
of the work or services, including,
without limitation, the names of all
MBEs and FBEs contacted by the
bidder or prime contractor; and 2)
written approval of the Director of
OEO.

The City Record
(b) Exception. If a potential bidder is unable to meet the MBE/FBE
utilization goals for a particular
contract, it may seek, prior to the
bid opening date, an exception to
the goals by submitting a written
request: To be eligible for an exception, a potential bidder must document its good faith efforts to utilize
MBEs and FBEs to achieve the
goals for the particular contract.
The request for exception must
identify either the absence of any
MBEs or FBEs qualified to perform
the work or the unavailability of
the MBEs and FBEs which the bidder contacted to perform the contract work and shall attest and document that unavailability or inability to perform work on the contract
was for reasons other than an
inability to agree on price.
(c) Substitution During Contract
Term; Waiver. If, after execution of
a contract, the contractor is unable
to utilize one or more certified
MBEs or FBEs identified in its bid,
it must employ substitute certified
MBEs or FBEs, respectively, to fulfill its MBE and/or FBE commitment. If the contractor identified
more than one MBE or FBE as a
subcontractor/supplier in its bid, it
must, to the extent possible, utilize
the same percentages of MBEs and
FBEs throughout performance of
the contract. The substitute MBE or
FBE must perform the same type of
work as the MBE or FBE it
replaces. If, after reasonable good
faith efforts documented to the
Director, the contractor is unable to
locate and employ a substitute MBE
or FBE to perform the same type of
work as the MBE or FBE the contractor is unable to use, the contractor may increase the participation in the contract of other identified MBEs and FBEs, if any. If,
after reasonable good faith efforts,
the contractor is unable to locate
and employ a substitute MBE or
FBE and there are no other MBEs
or FBEs identified to the contract
or the remaining MBEs and FBEs
are unable for reasons documented
to the satisfaction of the Director,
to increase their participation in the
contract, the contractor may request
in writing a waiver of the participation goals for the particular contract from the Director. The request
shall document the specific reasons
for the contractor’s inability to meet
the bid or contract requirements and
identify the MBEs and FBEs which
the bidder contacted to perform
work on the contract. The contractor shall attest and document that
the MBEs and FBEs identified were
unavailable or unable to perform
work on the contract for reasons
other than the inability to agree on
price.
(d) Waiver Prior to Bidding. Prior
to the solicitation of bids or proposals, a contracting department
may request in writing the Director
to waive or reduce a goal for MBE
or FBE participation in a particular
contract stating the reasons for the
request. The Director may grant
such a waiver or reduction request
if:
(1) The reasonable and necessary
requirements of the contract and the
nature or type of work or services
or goods render subcontracting by
the bidder or proposer infeasible; or
(2) Certified MBEs and FBEs capable of providing the goods or

1767

55
services required by the contract
are unavailable in the Cleveland
contracting market, as shown by
prior good faith efforts to identify
them.
When granting a reduction of a
goal for a particular contract in
accordance with this section, the
Director will specify the percentage
participation to which the goal has
been reduced. Whenever the Director denies a request to waive or
reduce a contract goal, the contracting department which requested the waiver or reduction may
appeal the denial to the Mayor. The
Mayor’s decision on the appeal is
final.
(e)
Waiver
by
Department.
Notwithstanding the provisions of
division (d) of this Section 3.07, a
contracting department may waive
the goals for a particular contract
if:
(1) The director of the contracting department finds, with the
advice of the Director, that the
goods or services are available only
from one source, which source is not
then disqualified from doing business with the City; and
(2) The director of the contracting department certifies in writing
to the Director that:
A. an emergency exists of the
character described in Section 181.12
of the Codified Ordinances which
requires the availability of the
desired goods or services so urgently that the contracting department
is unable to both comply with the
requirements of the Code and these
Regulations and to obtain the goods
or services in time to alleviate the
emergency; and
B. the prospective contractor is an
MBE or FBE or, if not, that the
prospective contractor has represented that it will make every effort
to subcontract to MBEs and FBEs
if subcontracting is utilized.
3.08 Contract Set-Aside
(a) To further achieve the annual City-wide goals for MBE and
FBE participation in contracts, the
director of a contracting department, in consultation with the Director, may elect to solicit bids or proposals for a particular contract from
MBEs and FBEs only, provided that
the estimated total cost of the contract does not exceed fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000). Prior to issuing it,
the contracting department shall
furnish the Director with a copy of
the bid invitation or request for proposals for such contract. The Director shall, within five (5) business
days thereafter, provide the contracting department with a list of
certified MBEs and FBEs from
which bids or proposals can be
invited or requested, as appropriate.
(b) The director of the contracting department shall notify the City
Council in writing, copy to the
Director, whenever the decision has
been made to solicit bids or proposals from MBEs or FBEs only pursuant to this Section 3.08.
3.09 Subsidiaries, Change Orders
and Contract Amendments
To the extent possible, as determined by the Director, a contractor

The City Record

56
shall maintain the same percentage
of participation by MBE and FBEs
in any work performed pursuant to
a subsidiary agreement, contract
change order or contract amendment as specified by the contractor
in its bid or proposal for the contract. The director of the contracting department shall consult with
the Director prior to approving any
subsidiary
agreement,
contract
change order or contract amendment which will result in a significant increase or decrease in the
amount of work to be performed in
a contract to identify the efforts
that the contractor will utilize to
comply with the requirement contained in this Section 3.09.
IV. COMPLIANCE WITH
CITY’S EMPLOY GOALS

THE

4.01 Certification, Recertification
and Reconsideration
(a) Certification Requirements.
Each bidder and contractor who
wishes or has contracted to do business with the City must either comply with the goals for the employment of minorities and females
fixed by the Director and inserted
by the contracting department in
the bid specifications or request for
proposals for a particular contract
or describe by a written plan filed
with and approved by OEO how it
will
ensure
equal
employment
opportunities for its employees by
taking specific affirmative actions
(“Affirmative Action Plan”). When
it accomplishes either, the Director
will issue a certificate of employment compliance. At the time it submits a bid or proposal to the City,
each bidder must:
(1) Either submit a copy of or
have on file in OEO the bidder’s currently
effective
certificate
of
employment compliance issued and
maintained pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.01 and verifying
that
the
bidder
employs
minorities and females at all levels
of its work force at levels consistent with the employment goals
fixed by the Director; or
(2) Either submit a copy of or
have on file in OEO the bidder’s currently effective statement of deemed
compliance issued and maintained
pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 4.01; or
(3)
Submit
a
completed
and
signed Contract Employment Report
(Schedule 1) or other application for
a certificate of employment compliance or a statement of deemed compliance.
Applications for a certificate of
employment compliance or a statement of deemed compliance shall be
submitted on forms provided by
OEO. Failure to provide all information requested by the forms will
result in rejection of the bid.
(b) Deemed Employment Compliance. If a bidder is unable to demonstrate that it employs minorities
and females consistent with the
employment goals fixed by the
Director and inserted by the contracting department in the bid specifications or request for proposals
for a particular contract, the bidder
may be deemed by the Director to
be in compliance with the City’s
employment goals if it demonstrates
in the required submittals that it
ensures equal employment opportunities by means of specific affirmative actions. In order to be eligible

for a statement of deemed compliance, a bidder must submit with its
bid or proposal or have previously
filed with OEO:
(1)
An
approved
affirmative
action
plan
for
continuing
its
progress in hiring and promoting
minorities and females in accordance with the provisions of Section
4.02; and
(2) Verification that it is then
making or intends to make significant progress in hiring and promoting minorities and females in its
workforce; and
(3) By responses to the action
items listed on the Contract Employment Report (Schedule 1) submitted
with the bid or proposal, demonstration of a willingness to comply
with the requirements of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Program
of the City of Cleveland.
Failure to meet this requirement
will result in an evaluation of noncompliance.
(c) Other Information Considered.
In evaluating a bidder or a contractor for a certificate of employment compliance or a statement of
deemed compliance, the Director
will consider the information contained in the required submittals
and may consider in addition:
(1) Changes in the number of
offers
of
employment
made
to
minorities and females in recent
years;
(2) Compliance with the City’s
employment goals at a national
level, if not within the Cleveland
contracting market;
(3) Any certificates of employment compliance received by the
bidder from other governmental
agencies. (Note: Certification by
other governmental agencies alone
will not qualify a bidder for certification by OEO.)
(d)
Required Bidder Explanations. In addition to any other
requirement of this Section 4.01, if
the information in the bidder’s Contract Employment Report (Schedule
1) indicates that the bidder employs
fewer than the Number of Minorities
or Females identified in the following schedule corresponding to the
Total Number of Employees in its
workforce, the bidder must also submit with its bid written reasons for
the low number of minorities or
females in the bidder’s workforce
and the reasons why the bidder
believes that the Director should
issue a statement of deemed compliance:
Number of
Minority or
Female
Employees

Total Number
of Employees
5 to 10 Employees

No Minority or
Female Employees
11 to 50 Employees
Fewer than 2
Minority Employees/No
Female Employees
More than 50 Employees
Fewer than
5% Minority
Employees/Fewer
than 3%
Female Employees

1768

September 11, 1996
Failure of a bidder to submit such
explanation or reasons will result in
a conclusive presumption by the
Director that the bidder is not in
compliance with the City’s employment goals.
(e) Subcontractor Compliance. A
contractor shall not utilize in the
performance of a contract any subcontractor which has been determined by OEO to be not in compliance with the City’s employment
goals.
(f)
Term
of
Effectiveness;
Progress Reports. Certificates of
employment compliance are effective for one year from the date of
issuance by the Director and statements of deemed compliance are
effective for six months from the
date of issuance by the Director,
unless either is sooner withdrawn in
accordance with Part VI of these
Regulations or extended by the
Director. Each holder of a statement
of deemed compliance must submit
progress reports to the Director
three (3) months from date of
issuance of the statement and every
three (3) months thereafter describing its specific efforts to meet and
implement the provisions of the
holder’s approved affirmative action
plan. At such other times as the
Director or the Director’s designee
requests, a holder of a certificate of
employment compliance or a statement of deemed compliance must
submit to the Director a current
Contract
Employment
Report
(Schedule 1) and such other information as the Director considers
necessary to verify compliance with
the holder’s representations to the
City.
(g) Renewal of Certificate. Prior
to the expiration of the certificate
of employment compliance, the holder may apply for renewal of the certificate on forms provided by OEO.
Prior to expiration of a statement of
deemed compliance, the holder may
apply for renewal of the statement
on forms provided by OEO. In order
to avoid a lapse in the certificate or
statement, the application must be
received at least thirty (30) days
prior to the expiration of the certificate or statement. Each holder is
responsible to initiate the process of
applying for a new certificate or
statement. The failure of the holder
to apply for a new certificate or
statement by the expiration date
will result in the expiration of the
certificate
or
statement
without
renewal.
(h) Limitation on Deemed Compliance; Reapplication. After receipt
of four (4) consecutive statements
of deemed compliance, a bidder or
contractor will not be eligible to
obtain an additional statement of
deemed compliance unless it is able
to explain to the satisfaction of an
Administrator in an application for
a statement of deemed compliance
its inability to meet the employment
goals fixed by the Director. In addition to submitting the application
for a statement of deemed compliance, the principal(s) of the contractor shall meet with an Administrator to explain the reasons for
continued noncompliance with the
goals and shall submit a revised
affirmative action plan acceptable
to the Administrator. Such plan
shall detail the steps that the contractor will take to ensure that it
offers equal employment opportuni-

ties. If the contractor is then issued
a new statement of deemed compliance, the process set forth in this
division (h) will be repeated at a
time to be determined by the Administrator at least once a year in each
year thereafter until such time as
the contractor becomes eligible for
a certificate of employment compliance or is determined to be in noncompliance. If the Director then
determines not to issue a statement
of deemed compliance, the bidder or
contractor may not reapply for such
a statement.
(i) Notice of Pre-Bid Conference.
Contracting
departments
should
notify OEO at least ten (10) days in
advance of each pre-bid conference
in order to ensure that bidders may
properly follow the procedures set
forth in this Section 4.01 for compliance with the City’s employment
goals.
(j) Reconsideration Requests. An
applicant may request reconsideration of the decision of the Director
denying a certificate of employment
compliance
or
a
statement
of
deemed compliance by depositing a
notice of appeal in the U.S. mail
within five (5) business days of
receipt of the Director’s determination. In reconsidering the application, the Director will review the
contents of the file and such new
information not previously submitted as the applicant may submit in
its request. If the Director finds
that
the
new
information
or
changed circumstances bring the
applicant in compliance with the criteria stated in these Regulations for
the certificate or statement sought,
the Director will issue the appropriate document.
4.02 Affirmative Action Plans
(a) Suggested elements of a “good
faith” affirmative action plan are
listed below, which list is neither
exhaustive nor is every element
mandatory.
Each
employer
may
choose those elements most applicable to it, and is encouraged to adapt
them to its business and work force
and to exercise imagination and
innovation in developing an effective affirmative action plan. The
Director will evaluate the plan in
its entirety as a gauge of the
employer’s commitment to achieving
equal opportunity.
(b) Elements of a “good faith”
affirmative action plan include, but
are not limited to, a commitment by
an employer to:
(1) The establishment of bothlong-term and short-term minority
and female employment goals and
timetables for each specific job classification, taking into account the
availability of qualified persons in
each classification in the relevant
market.
(2) A systematic effort to organize work and redesign jobs in
ways that provide opportunities for
persons lacking “journeyman” level
knowledge or skills to enter and,
with
appropriate
training,
to
progress in a career field.

females.
(6) The establishment of a system
for regularly monitoring the effectiveness of the employer’s affirmative action program, and procedures
for making timely adjustments in
such program where its effectiveness has not been demonstrated.
V. COMPLIANCE MONITORING
(a) OEO will monitor compliance
with the Code and these Regulations by all contractors, subcontractors, MBEs, FBEs, and certified
joint ventures. OEO shall monitor
contract
compliance,
employment
compliance and whether business
enterprises are bona fide MBEs or
FBEs or MBE or FBE joint ventures. In monitoring, OEO may visit
office(s) and job site(s) for the purposes of inspecting records, verifying employment participation and
MBE and FBE utilization in the performance of contracts. In monitoring compliance, it will be assumed
that contractors will be able to meet
or exceed the goals specified in the
contract.
(b) The failure of a business
enterprise to cooperate in the monitoring by OEO of compliance with
the Code and these actions will be
deemed admission that the business
enterprise is not in compliance with
the Code and these Regulations, and
will constitute a violation of the
Code.
VI. NONCOMPLIANCE BY A CONTRACTOR

organiza-

1769

(a) If an Administrator believes
that any contractor, subcontractor,
MBE or FBE has failed to comply
with any of the requirements of the
Code or these Regulations, has
failed to ensure equal employment
opportunities or failed to take specific affirmative actions with regard
to employment as set forth in an
affirmative action plan or has misrepresented any fact contained in
any document filed with OEO pursuant to the Code or these Regulations, the Administrator will notify
the contractor, subcontractor, MBE
or FBE of this determination by certified mail or personal delivery. The
notice shall give the contractor, subcontractor, MBE or FBE five (5)
business days from receipt of the
notice, or such additional time specified in the notice, to submit records
or offer other information to explain
or disprove the misrepresentation or
apparent failure of compliance, and
to demonstrate its compliance and
the truth of its representations. The
Administrator may consider failure
of the contractor, subcontractor,
MBE or FBE to submit records or
other information as requested in
the notice or otherwise acknowledge a willingness to cooperate
with the investigation as an admission by the contractor, subcontractor, MBE or FBE of the correctness
of that determination.
(b) If the contractor, subcontractor, MBE or FBE admits the determination or the Administrator determines, after reviewing any records
or information submitted by such
contractor, subcontractor, MBE or
FBE in response to the notice issued
pursuant to division (a) of this Part
VI, that such contractor, subcontractor, MBE or FBE is not in compliance with the Code, these Regulations, the appropriate contract provisions or has misrepresented facts
in documents filed with OEO, then
the Administrator will issue a written finding of noncompliance or
default stating the basis for the
finding and notifying the contractor, subcontractor, MBE or FBE of
its right to object to the finding.
The finding and notice will be sent
by certified mail return receipt
requested or personal delivery. A
copy of written findings of noncompliance or default shall be sent to
the contracting department.
(c) Any contractor, subcontractor,
MBE or FBE taking exception to a
finding of the Administrator issued
pursuant to division (b) of this Part
VI may, within five (5) days of
receipt of the Administrator’s written finding, attempt to reconcile the
differences through informal methods of conciliation and persuasion
and/or file with the Administrator a
written objection, stating the reasons for the objection by certified
mail. The Administrator may enter
into a settlement agreement regarding the finding. If a written objection is filed, the Administrator will
forward the objection to the Director within fiveø (5) days of its
receipt together with the Administrator’s
recommendation
of
the
appropriate remedial action(s) or
sanction(s) to be taken by the
Director and all materials pertaining thereto.
(d) If the Administrator finds a
contractor, subcontractor, MBE or
FBE to be in noncompliance or
default and such contractor, subcontractor, MBE or FBE has not

The City Record

58
timely responded to notice of the
Administrator’s
determination
as
permitted by division (c) of this
Part VI, the Administrator will forward the findings to the Director
along with a recommendation of
appropriate remedial action or sanctions to be imposed. The Director
must then decide solely upon the
information supplied by the Administrator whether or not to affirm or
reject, wholly or partly, the findings
of the Administrator. If the Director
affirms the findings of the Administrator, then the Director may take
such action set forth in Section
187.09 of the Codified Ordinances as
the Director determines is applicable and consistent with the action.
(e) The contracting department
shall be notified of the ultimate resolution by OEO of the written findings of noncompliance or default
issued by the Administrator pursuant to division (b) of this Part VI.
VII. APPEAL PROCESS
(a) If a contractor, subcontractor,
MBE or FBE files a timely objection to a written finding by the
Administrator of noncompliance or
default pursuant to Part VI of these
Regulations, then the Director must
hold a hearing on the appeal or
objection. The hearing must be held
not less than five (5) days nor more
than ten (10) days from the filing
of the appeal, unless the appellant
and the Director mutually agree otherwise. The Director shall send
notice of the date, time, and place
for the hearing by certified mail to
all interested parties. The appellant
shall have the right to record the
proceedings of the hearing at its
sole expense.
(b) Within five (5) days after the
hearing, the Director must issue and
send by certified mail to the appellant, findings of fact and a determination of compliance or noncompliance with the Code and these
Regulations. If the Director rejects

the findings, the Director shall concurrently issue the appropriate certificate or statement. If the Director
determines that the appellant was
not in compliance on any grounds
with the Code, these Regulations,
the appropriate contract provisions,
or that appellant has misrepresented facts pertinent to its compliance
obligations, the Director, in addition
to whatever other remedies may be
available with respect to the Director’s
findings
and
any
other
defaults under any contract in question, may cancel appellants currently effective certification or statement
and/or
take
such
other
action(s) set forth in Section 187.09
of the Codified Ordinances. The
decision of the Director is final and
may be appealed to the City’s Board
of Zoning Appeals.
VIII. AUTHORITY OF OEO
All functions of OEO shall be performed by the employees of OEO
under the direction of the Director.
No certifications regarding compliance with the Code, these Regulations, or any contract provisions
regarding MBE or FBE utilization,
employment compliance or bona fide
MBE or FBE status shall be valid
except when authorized by OEO.
IX. AMENDMENT
The Director may amend and
revise these Regulations from time
to time or upon recommendation of
the Review and Evaluation Committee,
by
publication
of
each
amended or revised section in the
City Record. An amendment or revision shall be effective as of and
from the City Record publication
date, unless otherwise provided in
the amendment or revision or the
publication notice.
X. SEVERABILITY
If any provision of these Regulations or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held

September 11, 1996
invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections which can be given effect
without the invalid provision or
application, and to this end the provisions are severable.
