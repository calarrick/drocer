code and also saved
the senior meals programs and
helped to
establish a community
responsive transit system; and
Whereas, also as Mayor of Cleveland, Dennis J. Kucinich,
steadfastly opposed the sale of the Cleveland Municipal Light
System, and
because of that opposition, has
saved its customers over $200 million on their electric bills; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure
providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that it is most
fitting and appropriate to recognize
Dennis J. Kucinich for his years of
dedicated service to the citizens of
Cleveland by naming an appropriate public facility, such as Cleveland Public Power or a part thereof, after Dennis J. Kucinich; now,

Section 1. That this Council congratulates Dennis J.
Kucinich for
his many years of dedicated service

respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
safety and welfare pursuant to Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised

of notification; now, therefore,
