Whereas, this Council is aware of

2148

November 27, 1996
the congested conditions of the
State of Ohio’s correctional institutions and is desirous of investigating various alternatives to incarceration; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that regulations for Correctional Halfway Houses, including
regulations concerning their location and operation are critical to the
avoidance of detrimental affects on
the public health, safety, and general welfare, particularly in neighborhoods the City is attempting to
preserve and revitalize; and
Whereas, current City ordinances
do not adequately provide for the
regulation of Correctional Halfway
Houses; and
Whereas, the City is developing
regulations
for
Correctional
Halfway Houses; and
Whereas, the various departments
of the City require an additional
ninety (90) days in order to properly complete regulations for the
establishment, expansion, or operation of Correctional Halfway houses within the City in order to protect the
public health, safety,
morals, and general welfare; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That for purposes of
this
Ordinance,
“Correctional
Halfway House” means a premises
which provides room and board and
rehabilitative services to individuals who have been assigned to or
referred to such facility by either a
governmental authority or court of
law as furloughees, parolees, probationers, or in any other confinement
status within the correctional system.
Section 2. That, notwithstanding
and as an exception to any and all
provisions of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, to
the contrary, no City department
shall accept an application for any
permit
where
such

relates to the establishment, expansion, or operation of a Correctional
Halfway House until the City has
completed
its
review
of
public
health, safety, morals, and general
welfare issues with respect to the
manner
in
which
Correctional
Halfway Houses are provided for in
the community and has adopted regulations addressing same, or until
ninety (90) days have passed following the effective date of this
ordinance, whichever is first to
occur.
Section 3. That refusal of an
application under this ordinance
may be appealed to the appropriate
board for consideration pursuant to
authority in Section 76-6(b) of the
Charter of the City of Cleveland.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL

By Councilman O’Malley.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the renewal of
a Liquor Permit to 4462-64 State
Road, and repealing Res. No. 152496, objecting to said renewal.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the renewal of a Liquor Permit to
4462-64 State Road by Res. No. 152496, adopted August 14, 1996; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
renewal and consents to said renewal; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to the
renewal of a Liquor Permit to 446264 State Road be and the same is
hereby withdrawn and Res. No. 152496, containing said objection, be and
the same is hereby repealed and
that this Council consents to the

Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

Res. No. 2136-96.
By Councilmen Westbrook and
Patton.
An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed merger of Centerior
Energy Company, parent company
of Cleveland Electric Illuminating
Company, and the Ohio Edison Company.
Whereas, the Ohio Edison Company has proposed to acquire the Centerior Energy Company, parent of
Cleveland
Electric
Illuminating
Company; and
Whereas, on November 8, 1996,
these companies filed at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) a Joint Application for
approval of the merger of the companies into a single electric utility
to be known as FirstEnergy Corp.
(FERC Docket No. EC97-5-000); and
Whereas, on November 15, 1996,
these companies filed an Application and a Stipulation and Recommendation before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO),
which would affect rates and services provided by CEI to its customers for the next nine years, and
which sets a deadline for PUCO
approval of January 31, 1997 (PUCO
Case No. 96-1211-EL-UNC); and
Whereas, this Council is particularly concerned that the proposed
merger may strengthen the ability
of these companies to pass along socalled stranded investment costs to
the retail consumers; and
Whereas, many of these stranded
investment
costs
resulted
from
financial
mismanagement
and
should not be recoverable from the
rate payers, regardless of whether
retail wheeling is ever approved;
and

The City Record
Whereas, the elimination of competition
between
the
companies
through this merger may greatly
decrease their incentive to bear
responsibility for these costs; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about an expedited process
caused by the artificial deadline set
by the companies for PUCO action
on their Application and Stipulation;
and
Whereas, this Council is also concerned that the merger may unfairly impact municipal competitive
alternatives, and particularly Cleveland Public Power (CPP), through
the use of a greater monopoly on
power generation and transmission
of electricity; and
Whereas, the PUCO must carefully consider the high level of current
rates and the need for immediate
rate reductions, as well as the need
to maintain regulatory control by
the PUCO and consumer oversight
over Centerior and FirstEnergy; and
Whereas, the PUCO should ensure
that the companies maintain and
increase funding for low income
weatherization and energy efficiency measures; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that the proposal by Ohio Edison to acquire Centerior Energy, will have a profound
effect on customers of CEI within
the City of Cleveland, as well as a
profound effect on competition in
the provision of retail and wholesale electric services; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the merger of Centerior Energy
Company, parent company of Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company,
and the Ohio Edison Company as
proposed, and opposes an expedited
process on the proposed Application
and Stipulation before the PUCO.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the Administration to all appropriate actions to oppose the merger
before the FERC and the PUCO.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to each of
the companies that are parties to
the proposed merger, the FERC, the
PUCO, and the Office of Consumers’
Counsel.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
