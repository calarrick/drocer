Engineering & Manufacturing, Inc.,
or its designee, to provide for a ten
year abatement for certain tangible
personal property and real estate
taxes as an incentive to expand its
facilities to 6501 Barberton Avenue
located in the Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 948-95, passed June 19, 1995, this
Council designated an area which is
in
the
City
of
Cleveland
and
described in File No. 948-95-A, as the

(the “Zone”) pursuant to Chapter
5709 of the Ohio Revised Code; and
Whereas, in August, 1995, the
Director of Development of the State
of Ohio determined that the Zone
contains
the
characteristics
set
forth in Section 5709.61(A) of the
Revised Code and certified said
area as an “Urban Jobs and Enterprise Zone” pursuant to Chapter
5709 of the Revised Code; and
Whereas, Eagle Engineering &
Manufacturing, Inc., (the “Enterprise”) has proposed to expand its
facilities at its operation in the City
of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that, but for abatement of personal property and real
estate taxes the Enterprise would
be at a competitive disadvantage by
operating at this location; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure in that
the same provides for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
safety, property, and welfare and
for the further reason that its enactment is a necessary prerequisite to
providing immediate assistance to
create and preserve job opportunities and advance and promote commercial and economic development
in the City of Cleveland, such assistance being immediately necessary
or such jobs will be lost; now, therefore,

An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Finance to

for a term not to exceed two years,
for the public purpose of leasing
space for the offices of the Division
of Information Systems Services.
RESOLUTION
Res. No. 375-96.
By Councilman Melena.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor and the Administration to
plan for the utilization of clean
material from the demolition of
Cleveland
Municipal
Stadium
to
expand the Cuyahoga County Commissioners Reef or build new reefs
in order to create the largest freshwater artificial reef system in the
world.
Whereas, since the late 1700’s the
Japanese have successfully used
artificial reef technology to create
and
enhance
coastal
fishing
grounds; and
Whereas, the Western Basin of

1823

19
Lake Erie is known as the “Walleye Capital of the World” because
this area produces more walleye per
hectare than any other lake in the
world; and
Whereas, the Western Basin is
shallow and dotted with islands and
natural reefs which provide necessary habitat for many fish species
including bass, perch and walleye;
and
Whereas, the Central Basin is
deeper, larger and lacks the necessary near shore productive bottom
structures nature provided the Western Basin; and
Whereas, since the central basin
lacks the near shore structures necessary to fish habitats the Central
Basin fishing areas are not within
safe running distance for smaller
boats; and
Whereas, in the 1980’s the North
Central Ohio Sea Grant Committee
caused the creation of artificial
reefs in Lake Erie off the coast of
Lorain and Cuyahoga Counties; and
Whereas, in 1984 the Cuyahoga
County Commissioners contributed
$62,500.00 towards the artificial reef
off the Cuyahoga County Coast; and
Whereas, said artificial reef is
known as the “Cuyahoga County
Commissioner’s Reef”; and
Whereas, in 1984, the Cuyahoga
County
Commissioners
estimated
that the artificial reef off the Cuyahoga County Coast was expected to
inject over 50 million dollars into
the local economy; and
Whereas, studies of the Cuyahoga
County Commissioner’s Reef have
shown the reef to have exceeded
expectations in its impact on fishing in the Central Basin; and
Whereas, an expansion of the
existing artificial reef systems in
the Western Basin will further concentrate fish within a given area
near shore; and
Whereas, artificial reef expansion
will create permanent habitats for
many fish species by providing
food,
shelter,
protection
and
a
spawning area; and
Whereas, the expansion of near
shore permanent fish habitat will
benefit
the
Cleveland
economy
through non-local anglers’ expenditures of gas, food, bait, tackle and
overnight lodging; and
Whereas, if the proposed settlement between the NFL and the City
of Cleveland is approved, Cleveland
Municipal Stadium will be demolished and a new facility will be
built to house the Cleveland Browns
NFL franchise; and
Whereas, in order to demolish
Municipal
Stadium
lead
and
asbestos abatement of the structure
must be completed prior to demolition; and
Whereas, upon demolition of the
structure, a huge quantity of clean
brick and concrete rubble will need
to be transported off site and disposed of; and
Whereas, the brick and concrete
rubble created by the proposed
demolition of Municipal Stadium
would only need to be transported
across the street to the Port of
Cleveland and hauled to a reef site
for use in expansion of the reef system; and
Whereas, the use of the brick and
concrete rubble for expansion of the
artificial reef system will save hundreds of thousands of dollars in the
current demolition budget for the
proposed stadium; and
Whereas, the use of said concrete
and brick rubble to build artificial
reef structures will save scarce

The City Record

20
landfill resources and create an
asset at minimal cost which will
survive
for
many
generations
beyond the proposed facility; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that plans for a
new artificial reef to benefit the
Cleveland
area
should
proceed
simultaneously with plans for the
future of Cleveland Municipal Stadium; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Mayor and the Administration to
plan for the utilization of clean
material from the demolition of
Cleveland
Municipal
Stadium
to
expand the Cuyahoga County Commissioners Reef or build new reefs
in order to create the largest freshwater artificial reef system in the
world.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to the Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Councilmen Polensek, Willis,

Patton, Paulenske, Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor George Voinovich and the
State Highway Patrol to patrol and
provide traffic enforcement along
the interstate highways that go
through the City of Cleveland.
Whereas, the Cleveland Police
Division
is
presently
enforcing
speed limits and conducting patrols
on interstate highways that go
through the City of Cleveland in
order to ensure the safety of citizens and the general public; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Police
Division must utilize patrol officers
to patrol, monitor and enforce the
speed limit on those interstate highways that pass through Cleveland
at the expense of placing those officers on patrol in Cleveland neighborhoods to enhance the public safety; and
Whereas,
the
State
Highway
Patrol monitors and enforces the
speed limit on various interstate
highways throughout the State of
Ohio, and have assigned personnel
to patrol these specific areas; and
Whereas, it is most appropriate to
expand the patrol area of the State
Highway Patrol to include interstate highways I-71, I-77, I-480 and
I-90 that pass through Cleveland,
and assume responsibility on monitoring and enforcing the speed limit
on each interstate; and
Whereas, the assuming of these
responsibilities by the State Highway Patrol on the above mentioned
interstate highways will enable the
Cleveland Police Division to reassign police officers to neighborhood
patrol that will keep City streets
safe; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly urges the State Highway
Patrol to assume the responsibility
of enforcing the speed limit on
interstate highways I-71, I-77, I-480
and I-90 that pass through the City
of Cleveland and to patrol these specific areas which will enable the
Cleveland Police Division to reassign its’ officers who are presently
assigned to such enforcement to
neighborhood patrol of Cleveland
neighborhoods.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution
to
Governor
George
Voinovich and the Office of the
State Highway Patrol.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

Res. No. 1722-96.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the federal government to provide
drug treatment programs and economic development opportunities to

The City Record
black neighborhoods affected by
illegal drug trafficking by the CIA
during the early 1980s.
Whereas, this Council is shocked
by recent revelations in the newspapers linking the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) to the
introduction of crack cocaine into
black neighborhoods in order to
raise funds to support the CIAbacked Nicaraguan Contra army in
the early 1980s; and
Whereas,
according
to
these
reports, the CIA-backed drug network was responsible for introducing and selling crack cocaine in a
number of U.S. cities, including
Cleveland; and
Whereas, this purported misuse of
governmental power by a federal
agency must be thoroughly investigated and remedied; and
Whereas, at a minimum, the federal government must provide funding to combat drugs in the same
communities in which it reportedly
