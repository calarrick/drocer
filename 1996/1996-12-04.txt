Ohio General Assembly to support a
$4,000,000
increase
in
the
Ohio
Department of Health’s 1998-1999
HIV Drug Assistance budget for
protease inhibitors.
Whereas, there are 1,400 citizens
of Cleveland’s neighborhoods currently living with AIDS; and

women and children of all races, all
economic levels, all religions, in
cities and rural areas all over Ohio;
and
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Health’s AIDS Drug Advisory Committee, composed of physicians and
health care professionals, view the
inclusion of protease inhibitors in
the overall AIDS program as an
absolute necessity; and
Whereas, these protease inhibitors
have all been approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration

does not include protease inhibitors
and the only state among those with

the protease inhibitors in its program may cause Ohio to forfeit new
Ryan White funds in the amount of

therapies are providing improved
overall quality of life for its participants and it may even reduce the

for the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA).
Whereas, the Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act of
1991 (ISTEA) was created in part to
distribute
federal
transportation
funds on a regional basis, to efficiently address the diverse regional
demands for transportation infrastructure; and
Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Transportation identifies the Surface Transportation Program “provided unprecedented flexibility to
state and local officials and helped
assure that transportation investments would meet the unique needs
of their communities;” and
Whereas, the major findings of a
Cleveland State University study for
the Greater Cleveland Growth Association
regarding
surface

December 4, 1996
portation issues in Greater Cleveland include the need for integration of surface transportation planning with other transportation decisions for cost effective intermodal
linkages,
and
more
consistency
between
regional
transportation
decisions, and regional economic
development strategies; and
Whereas, ISTEA empowered the
Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) as the metropolitan
planning
organization
(MPO) responsible for planning and
distributing federal transportation
funds in Greater Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly urges our local federal representatives to support the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act so
that it may: 1) Further strengthen
the role of MPOs such as NOACA in
the area of regional planning and
the distribution of federal transportation funds, and 2) Promote
intermodal transportation linkages,
and 3) That priority be given to the
maintenance of existing infrastructure.
Section 2. The Clerk of Council
transmit copies of this resolution to
U.S.
Senators
John
Glenn
and
Michael DeWine and U.S Representatives
Louis
Stokes,
Steven
LaTourette, Sherrod Brown, Martin
Hoke and U.S. Representative-Elect
Dennis Kucinich.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1323-96.
By
Councilman
Smith
(by
request).
An emergency resolution declaring the intention to vacate a portion
of West 37th Place.
Whereas, this Council is satisfied
that there is good cause for vacating a portion of West 37th Place, as
hereinafter described, and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it hereby declares
its intention to vacate: The following described real property, located
in
Cleveland,
Cuyahoga
County,
Ohio, and known as;
Being all that portion of WEST
37TH PLACE (10.00 feet wide),
extending Southerly from the First

wide), to the Easterly prolongation
of the Southerly line of Sublot Number 106 in Sargent and Dixon’s ReSubdivision, as shown by the recorded plat in Volume 2 of Maps, Page
43 of Cuyahoga County Records.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

20
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 25, 1996.
Effective December 2, 1996.
Res. No. 2134-96.
By Councilman O’Malley.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the renewal of
a Liquor Permit to 4462-64 State
Road, and repealing Res. No. 152496, objecting to said renewal.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the renewal of a Liquor Permit to
4462-64 State Road by Res. No. 152496, adopted August 14, 1996; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
renewal and consents to said renewal; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to the
renewal of a Liquor Permit to 446264 State Road be and the same is
hereby withdrawn and Res. No. 152496, containing said objection, be and
the same is hereby repealed and
that this Council consents to the
immediate renewal thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 25, 1996.
Effective December 2, 1996.
Res. No. 2136-96.
By Councilmen Westbrook and
Patton.
An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed merger of Centerior
Energy Company, parent company
of Cleveland Electric Illuminating
Company, and the Ohio Edison Company.
Whereas, the Ohio Edison Company has proposed to acquire the Centerior Energy Company, parent of
Cleveland
Electric
Illuminating
Company; and
Whereas, on November 8, 1996,
these companies filed at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) a Joint Application for
approval of the merger of the companies into a single electric utility
to be known as FirstEnergy Corp.
(FERC Docket No. EC97-5-000); and
Whereas, on November 15, 1996,
these companies filed an Application and a Stipulation and Recommendation before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO),
which would affect rates and services provided by CEI to its customers for the next nine years, and
which sets a deadline for PUCO
approval of January 31, 1997 (PUCO
Case No. 96-1211-EL-UNC); and
Whereas, this Council is particularly concerned that the proposed
merger may strengthen the ability
of these companies to pass along socalled stranded investment costs to
the retail consumers; and
Whereas, many of these stranded

The City Record
investment
costs
resulted
from
financial
mismanagement
and
should not be recoverable from the
rate payers, regardless of whether
retail wheeling is ever approved;
and
Whereas, the elimination of competition
between
the
companies
through this merger may greatly
decrease their incentive to bear
responsibility for these costs; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about an expedited process
caused by the artificial deadline set
by the companies for PUCO action
on their Application and Stipulation;
and
Whereas, this Council is also concerned that the merger may unfairly impact municipal competitive
alternatives, and particularly Cleveland Public Power (CPP), through
the use of a greater monopoly on
power generation and transmission
of electricity; and
Whereas, the PUCO must carefully consider the high level of current
rates and the need for immediate
rate reductions, as well as the need
to maintain regulatory control by
the PUCO and consumer oversight
over Centerior and FirstEnergy; and
Whereas, the PUCO should ensure
that the companies maintain and
increase funding for low income
weatherization and energy efficiency measures; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that the proposal by Ohio Edison to acquire Centerior Energy, will have a profound
effect on customers of CEI within
the City of Cleveland, as well as a
profound effect on competition in
the provision of retail and wholesale electric services; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the merger of Centerior Energy
Company, parent company of Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company,
and the Ohio Edison Company as
proposed, and opposes an expedited
process on the proposed Application
and Stipulation before the PUCO.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the Administration to all appropriate actions to oppose the merger
before the FERC and the PUCO.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to each of
the companies that are parties to
the proposed merger, the FERC, the
PUCO, and the Office of Consumers’
Counsel.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 25, 1996.
Effective December 2, 1996.
