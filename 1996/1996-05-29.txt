ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 955-96.
By Councilman Polensek.
An emergency resolution urging
the City to develop a program
designed
to
provide
specially
trained nurses to provide assistance
to victims of rape.
Whereas, New Jersey, Massachusetts and other states are developing statewide programs in which
certain designated nurses are specially trained to examine victims of
rape; and
Whereas, these programs are
based upon the City of Tulsa’s Sexual
Assault
Nurse
Examiners
(“SANE”) program which seeks to
provide more compassionate care for

May 29, 1996
victims of rape through specially
trained nurses; and
Whereas,
these
nurses
are
trained to respond to the victim's
physical trauma and become experienced in evidence collection to
help law enforcement officers in
locating the rapists; and
Whereas, such programs provide needed comfort to rape victims
and have increased the conviction
rate against their assailants;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that the victims
of rape need immediate assistance
in dealing with their trauma with
compassion and understanding; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council supports and urges the City to develop
a program designed to provide specially trained nurses to examine victims of rape based upon Tulsa’s
SANE program.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted May 20, 1996.
Effective May 29, 1996.
Res. No. 956-96.
By Councilman Rybka.
An emergency resolution in support
of
State
Senator
Dennis
Kucinich’s
proposed
legislation
relating to the use of guns in the
commission of a crime.
Whereas, the life of Cleveland resident Robin Kasper of Slavic Village was violently taken on December 13, 1995 at an automated teller
machine at East 71st Street and
Broadway Avenue by a criminal
pointing a gun; and
Whereas, the defendant, Vincent
Wright, claimed that the gun that
killed Ms. Kasper went off accidentally; and
Whereas, it is an intentional decision to use a gun in conjunction
with the commission of a crime; and
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby support the legislation to be
introduced by State Senator Dennis
Kucinich which will eliminate the
requirement that the State prove
that the defendant had the requisite
intent to kill in cases where defendants use guns in the commission of
a crime.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be hereby directed to transmit
four certified copies of this resolution
to
State
Senator
Dennis
Kucinich, the Speaker of the State
House
of
Representatives,
the
Minority Leader of the State House
of Representatives and the Governor
Voinovich.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
