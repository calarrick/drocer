An emergency resolution calling
upon May Department Stores, operating locally as Kaufmann’s Department Stores, to take specific actions
to
ensure
contractor
compliance
with its own vendor conduct standards for its private label program.
Whereas, May Department Stores
(“Mays”) is one of the
most profitable retailers of apparel in the
United States and operates locally
as Kaufmann’s Department Stores;
and
Whereas, Mays operates a highly
profitable private label program in
which Mays contracts with outside
manufacturers to produce clothing
for name brands sold only at its own
stores, such as Claybrooke, Amanda Smith, Lord & Taylor, Karen
Scott, and
Valerie Stevens brands;
and
Whereas,
substantial
evidence
exists that significant
portions of
the clothing sold under Mays private
labels is produced under sweatshop
conditions both in the United States
and abroad; and
Whereas, Norton McNaughton, a
manufacturer of women’s apparel,

2284

December 25, 1996
which sold 38% of its products to
Mays in 1994, has contracted with
shops which were found to have
locked fire exits and major overtime
and minimum wage violations; and,
Whereas, workers at Y.P.S. International and Picasso Fashion, which
produce apparel for Mays, testified
to extensive violations of overtime
and child labor laws and that they
are
subject to physical abuse and
sexual harassment; and
Whereas, the vast majority of
workers producing apparel under
substandard labor conditions in the
United States are
minorities and
recent immigrants; and
Whereas, Mays also extensively
imports apparel from countries such
as Indonesia, Honduras, and Canada, where workers receive wages as
low at $.26 per hour and are
required to work inhumanely long
hours under poor working conditions; and
Whereas, although Mays has a
written policy of labor
standards
for its suppliers, Mays does not monitor
compliance
sufficiently
to
insure that products sold at its
stores were not produced in violation of fair and humane labor standards; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that this Council is
greatly
concerned and strongly
deplores the fact that there is a
strong basis to believe that a significant amount of apparel being
sold by Mays in Cleveland was produced under conditions of worker
exploitation contrary to standards of
fair humane labor practices; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls
upon Mays to take
the following
actions to ensure contractor compliance with its own vendor conduct
standards for its private label programs:
(1) Communicate its Code of Conduct to workers at its contract facilities in their own language, provide
for monitoring of the code by independent labor and human rights
organizations, and ensure that freedom of speech and association are
guaranteed
to
its
contractors’
employees;
(2) Use its large quality assurance
network
to
monitor
and
enforce compliance with its Vendor
Code of Conduct;
(3) Work with suppliers to encourage improved working conditions
rather than firing workers or shutting down facilities; and
(4) Use its size and market power
to work with other retailers to lift
minimum
standards
for
apparel
workers at home and abroad.
Section 2. That this Council urges
all Clevelanders
to employ best
efforts to avoid the purchase of
apparel produced
under substandard labor conditions, such as by
giving preference to products both
made in the United States of America and carrying a union label.
Section 3. That this Council also
urges Mayor Michael R. White and
his administration to work with
Mays to promote implementation of
the actions recommended in this resolution.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to David Farrell,
CEO of May Department Stores, Ted
Passig, Regional Administrator of

The City Record

December 25, 1996
Stores and to John Ryan, Executive
Director-Elect of the Greater Cleveland AFL-CIO Federation.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Tennessee not to demolish the Florida Street School.
Whereas, the Florida Street School

Whereas, the Board of Education

of Florida Street School to consider
