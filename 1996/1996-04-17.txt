to a maximum of twenty-five (25) square feet in area and seven (7) feet in height.
(e) Gasoline Service Stations. Signs for gasoline service stations shall conform with all regulations of this
chapter except for the maximum sign area regulations of division (a) of Section 350.14 and any regulations which
directly conflict with the regulations stated below:
(1) Free-standing Business Sign. Each station shall be permitted one (1) permanent free-standing business

the building wall and shall be set back at least two (2) feet from the outer edge of any street curb.
(3) No Building Permit shall be issued for such sign without approval of the City Planning Commission, which
shall consider the design quality of the sign and its compatibility with the design character of the subject property and surrounding properties. In addition to considering such general design factors as placement, proportions,
color, materials, and consistency with signs to be seen as a series, the City Planning Commission may specifically require use of non-rectangular, custom-shaped panels, exposed neon or reflected lighting, unobtrusive support structures, narrow-profile sign cabinets, or other design features necessary to ensure that a larger projecting sign will enhance the appearance of the building on which it is placed and the district in which it is located.
