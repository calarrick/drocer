FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 2020-A-96.
(As a substitute for Ord. No. 202096).
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 170.06 and Sections
396.01, 396.02, 396.03, 396.04, 396.05,
396.06, 396.07, 396.08, 396.09 and
396.99 thereof, all relating to notification, security and environmental
abatement at closed businesses.
Whereas, any building within the
City of Cleveland which is closed or
vacated by a commercial enterprise
should be reported to the appropriate authorities and, if needed, tested for environmental contamination
and hazardous materials; and
Whereas, any closed or vacant
commercial
building
should
be
secured to prevent vandalism; and
Whereas, Council finds that closed
and vacant buildings that contain
hazardous materials or that may
contaminate
the
environment
or
pose a substantial threat of fire are
a nuisance; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 170.06 thereof to read as
follows:
Section 170.06 Public Subsidies
Any agreement between the City
and a property owner or an employer which provides for any type of
public subsidy from the City, including tax abatement, shall provide as
a condition that the property owner
or employer agrees to reimburse the
City the full amount of the subsidy
if the property owner or employer
closes or vacates the facility benefiting from the subsidy at any time
subsequent to receiving the subsidy.
Section 2. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Sections 396.01, 396.02, 396.03,
396.04, 396.05, 396.06, 396.07, 396.08,
396.09 and 396.99 thereof to read,
respectively, as follows:

December 18, 1996
CHAPTER 396
NOTIFICATION, ENVIRONMENTAL
ABATEMENT AND
SECURING OF CLOSED OR
VACATED FACILITIES

Section 396.01 Definitions
As used in this Chapter:
(a) “Close” or “closing” means the
permanent cessation of business
operations at a facility. For purposes of this Chapter, “permanent”
means a period of time longer than
ninety (90) days.
(b) “Facility” means all building
or structures considered as a whole
located on a non-residential site or
on contiguous or adjacent non-residential sites and that are under common ownership or control.
(c) “Regulated substances” means
all hazardous and flammable substances regulated by this Title, as
well as petroleum, tires, and any
other hazardous or flammable substances regulated pursuant to federal, state, or local environmental
laws.
(d) “Vacate” or “vacant” means
abandoning a facility, or a majority
of the facility as measured in
square footage, such that no regular
activities or regular occupancy by
persons associated with the facility
is occurring. It does not include:
(1) Storage of materials regulated
by and in compliance with the
remainder of this Title.
(2) Storage of materials regulated
by and in compliance with state or
federal environmental law.
(3) Storage of materials being
actively used in normal business
processes. The burden is on the
owner, operator, or party in control
to show that the materials are in
active use.
(4) Storage of materials that are
not regulated substances and that
are stored by an entity that is in the
commercial storage business as a
part of that business.
Section 396.02 Legislative Findings and Declaration of Nuisance
(a) Council of the City of Cleveland finds that:
(1) Non-residential sites which are
closed for business but vacant and
open to entry by the general public
attract children to enter who may
encounter health or environmental
hazards, harbor vermin, serve as
temporary abode for vagrants and
criminals, invite dumping and illegal storage of hazardous and flammable substances, and are likely to
be damaged by vandals or set
ablaze by arsonists.
(2) Unkept and open grounds on
such sites invite the dumping of
garbage, rubbish, and hazardous
and other regulated substances.
(3) Thousands of structures in
this City are made of wood-frame
construction which is more flammable than other building types.
(4) Thousands of structures in
this City are situated on narrow lots
and in close proximity to one another, thereby increasing the risk of
conflagration and the spread of
environmental

Coats and Lewis.
An emergency resolution calling
upon May Department Stores, operating
locally
as
Kaufmann’s
Department Stores, to take specific
actions to ensure contractor compliance with its own vendor conduct
standards for its private label program.
Whereas, May Department Stores
(“Mays”) is one of the
most profitable retailers of apparel in the
United States and operates locally
as Kaufmann’s Department Stores;
and
Whereas, Mays operates a highly
profitable private label program in
which Mays contracts with outside
manufacturers to produce clothing
for name brands sold only at its own
stores, such as Claybrooke, Amanda Smith, Lord & Taylor, Karen
Scott, and
Valerie Stevens brands;
and
Whereas,
substantial
evidence
exists that significant
portions of
the clothing sold under Mays private
labels is produced under sweatshop
conditions both in the United States
and abroad; and
Whereas, Norton McNaughton, a

The City Record
manufacturer of women’s apparel,
which sold 38% of its products to
Mays in 1994, has contracted with
shops which were found to have
locked fire exits and major overtime
and minimum wage violations; and,
Whereas, workers at Y.P.S. International and Picasso Fashion, which
produce apparel for Mays, testified
to extensive violations of overtime
and child labor laws and that they
are
subject to physical abuse and
sexual harassment; and
Whereas, the vast majority of
workers producing apparel under
substandard labor conditions in the
United States are
minorities and
recent immigrants; and
Whereas, Mays also extensively
imports apparel from countries such
as Indonesia, Honduras, and Canada, where workers receive wages as
low at $.26 per hour and are
required to work inhumanely long
hours under poor working conditions; and
Whereas, although Mays has a
written policy of labor
standards
for its suppliers, Mays does not monitor
compliance
sufficiently
to
insure that products sold at its
stores were not produced in violation of fair and humane labor standards; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that this Council is
greatly
concerned and strongly
deplores the fact that there is a
strong basis to believe that a significant amount of apparel being
sold by Mays in Cleveland was produced under conditions of worker
exploitation contrary to standards of
fair humane labor practices; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls
upon Mays to take
the following
actions to ensure contractor compliance with its own vendor conduct
standards for its private label programs:
(1) Communicate its Code of Conduct to workers at its contract facilities in their own language, provide
for monitoring of the code by independent labor and human rights
organizations, and ensure that freedom of speech and association are
guaranteed
to
its
contractors’
employees;
(2) Use its large quality assurance
network
to
monitor
and
enforce compliance with its Vendor
Code of Conduct;
(3) Work with suppliers to encourage improved working conditions
rather than firing workers or shutting down facilities; and
(4) Use its size and market power
to work with other retailers to lift
minimum
standards
for
apparel
workers at home and abroad.
Section 2. That this Council urges
all Clevelanders
to employ best
efforts to avoid the purchase of
apparel produced
under substandard labor conditions, such as by
giving preference to products both
made in the United States of America and carrying a union label.
Section 3. That this Council also
urges Mayor Michael R. White and
his administration to work with
Mays to promote implementation of
the actions recommended in this resolution.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to David Farrell,
CEO of May Department Stores, Ted

2248

December 18, 1996
Passig, Regional Administrator of
Stores and to John Ryan, Executive
Director-Elect of the Greater Cleveland AFL-CIO Federation.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
