Collection and Disposal, Department

Whereas, this Council believes
that the City of Cleveland has the
finest waste collection program in

should do everything within our

collectors to do their job; and

back support belts by waste collectors will reduce the risk of back
injuries and make their job easier
and safer; and
Whereas, the average cost of
these back support belts is approximately $10 to $15 each; and
Whereas, because of the minimal
cost of back support belts, the
Administration will save money in
the long run by reducing the use of
sick time and the filing of worker’s
compensation claims resulting from
back related injuries; and
