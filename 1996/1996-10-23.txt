An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to create an advisory committee to review
and update the minimum eligibility
requirements for members of municipal school boards, including the

City School Board has been demonstrated by past failures of proposed
school levies; and

System and the accumulation of
debt; and
Whereas, other existing negative
conditions include the state of disrepair of school facilities, the high
percentage
of
school
students

tests, the shortage of text books and
after-school activities available to
students, and increasing safety concerns for both students and teachers around school facilities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,

therefore,

under U.S. Treasury Regulations
with
respect
to
reimbursements
from proceeds of tax-exempt obligations for temporary advances made,
prior to issuance of those obligations,
for
payments

airport
improvements.
Whereas, United States Treasury
Regulations
prescribe
conditions
under which proceeds of tax-exempt

1986

October 23, 1996
bonds, notes or other obligations
used to reimburse advances made
for certain expenditures paid before
the issuance of such obligations will
be deemed to be expended (or properly allocated to expenditures) for
purposes of Sections 103 and 141-150
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, so that upon such reimbursement the proceeds so used will not
further be subject to requirements
or restrictions under those sections
of the Internal Revenue Code; and
Whereas, certain provisions of
those Regulations require that there
be a Declaration of Official Intent
not later than 60 days, following
payment of the expenditure expected to be reimbursed from proceeds
of such obligations, and that the
reimbursement occur within prescribed time periods after the expenditure is paid or after the property
is placed in service; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
expects to expand and improve its
airport facilities at Cleveland Hopkins

to
increase and improve the transportation services available to the
public; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
take steps to permit those airport
improvements to be later financed
with tax-exempt obligations in compliance with the above-described
United States Treasury Regulations
and thereby reduce the cost of those
facilities, which obligations are to
be authorized by separate and subsequent legislation of this Council;

used herein:

from the proceeds of Reimbursement Bonds to be issued after those
expenditures are paid.

means the restoration to the City or
to the lessee or other obligor under
agreements between that obligor
and the City, as the case may be, of
money temporarily advanced from
other funds and spent for capital
expenditures
(and

under the Reimbursement Regulations, including any issuance costs
for Reimbursement Bonds) before
the issuance of the Reimbursement
Bonds, evidenced in writing by an

treated as expended for all or any
purposes of Sections 103 and 141 to

and

of the Reimbursement Bonds to

the Reimbursement Regulations to
satisfy the requirements for the
reimbursement to be treated as an
expenditure of such proceeds for
purposes of Sections 103 and 141 to
150 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986. No advance from any fund of
account or order for payment may
be made for expenditures (other
than expenditures excepted from

unless a Declaration of Official

officers or agents of the Department
