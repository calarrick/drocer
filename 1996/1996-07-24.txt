An emergency ordinance to enact
Sections 633.01, 633.02, 633.03, 633.04,

federal
law
also
requires lighting and marking for
some obstructions under 200 feet,
depending on the proximity of the
obstructions to airports; and
Whereas, the proliferation of cellular phones and personal pagers
has
resulted

towers, antennas, and obstructions
being constructed at a height just
under 200 feet to meet the increasing demand of these conveniences;
and
Whereas,
these
unlighted

Be it ordained by the Council of

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 1322-96.
By Councilman Patton.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to repeal
Revised Code Section 3761.03, related to damages in case of lynching,
and Revised Code Section 3761.09,
related to limitations of action for
lynching.
Whereas, this Council believes
that a lynching is and was among
the most heinous and offensive
crimes that can or could be committed against the person of another; and
Whereas, a lynching that does not
result in the death of the victim is
the equivalent of an attempted murder, and a lynching that does result
in the death of the victim is the
equivalent of a murder; and
Whereas, since an unsuccessful
lynching
is
the
equivalent
of
attempted murder, there is no rational reason for distinguishing the
damages available to persons who
survive a lynching from the damages available to victims of attempted murder; and
Whereas, since a successful lynching is the equivalent of murder,
there is no rational reason for limiting the commencement of actions
to two years when there is no such
limitation of actions for murder; and
Whereas, Revised Code Sections
3761.03 and 3761.09 probably were
implemented at a time when lynching of African Americans was in
vogue and not generally frowned
upon the the state legislatures
around the country; and
Whereas, in today’s climate where
church bombings and other racially
motivated hate crimes have escalated to alarming rates, this Council
feels it is appropriate to repeal Sections 3761.03 and 3761.09, and any
other
anti-reconstruction
era
statutes
which
may
have
been
enacted by the Ohio General Assembly; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the health, safety, and
welfare of the citizens of the State
of Ohio; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly to repeal
Revised Code Section 3761.03, relating to damages in case of lynching,
and Revised Code Section 3761.09,
relating to limitations of action for
lynching.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to State Senator Jeff Johnson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 1324-96.
By Councilman McGuirk.
An emergency resolution urging
the Director of Public Utilities to
negotiate with CEI and its parent
company Centerior Energy Corp. to
acquire all equipment and properties owned by CEI within the boundaries of the City of Cleveland that
would
benefit
Cleveland
Public
Power.
Whereas, Cleveland Public Power
is involved in a $450 Million expansion of its system in the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, CEI’s parent company,
Centerior Energy Corp., is in terrible financial trouble as fully documented to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio; and
Whereas,
Cleveland
Public
Power’s expansion in the City of
Cleveland is creating a duplication
of electrical services in the areas of
the electrical provider’s expansion;
and
Whereas, given CEI’s repeated
slow response time to complaints of
street light outages and downed
electrical poles, Cleveland Public
Power will provide better service
response to the citizens of Cleveland; and
Whereas,
Cleveland
Public
Power’s acquisition of certain of
CEI’s equipment and properties will
benefit both electrical providers by
eliminating duplication of services,
saving CPP money in its expansion
operations and helping CEI’s bottom
line with such acquisition of its
assets.
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly urges the Director of Pub-

services within the City boundaries.

to the Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

An emergency resolution urging
the
Administration
to
purchase
back support belts for all waste collectors, for the Division of Waste
Collection and Disposal, Department
of Public Service.
Whereas, this Council believes
that the City of Cleveland has the
finest waste collection program in
all of Northeast Ohio and that we
should do everything within our
power to make it easier for waste
collectors to do their job; and
Whereas, it has come to the attention of this Council that the use of
back support belts by waste collectors will reduce the risk of back
injuries and make their job easier
and safer; and
Whereas, the average cost of
these back support belts is approximately $10 to $15 each; and
Whereas, because of the minimal
cost of back support belts, the
Administration will save money in
the long run by reducing the use of
sick time and the filing of worker’s
compensation claims resulting from
back related injuries; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Administration to purchase back
support belts for all waste collectors, for the Division of Waste Collection and Disposal, Department of

respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public

injuries and make their job easier
and safer; and

the long run by reducing the use of
sick time and the filing of worker’s
compensation claims resulting from
back related injuries; and

along column line C. This isolation
joint was required to protect the

D. Pedestrian Bridge Connection
modifications (CE-G71)

roof flashing at the expansion joint
between the Pedestrian Bridge and
the Arena. Changes were required
