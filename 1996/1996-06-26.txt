Whereas, the granting of this

of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

By Councilmen Coats, Westbrook

An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Justice Department to move
swiftly and utilize all available
resources to identify the perpetrators of the recent surge of church
burnings, and urging the U.S. Congress to establish Community Reinvestment Act monies and to establish a source of federal funding
through grants and low interest
loans for rebuilding churches that
were and are burned down by perpetrators of hate crimes.
Whereas, this Council believes
that the burning down of churches
is among the most disgusting and
disgraceful acts that one can commit; and
Whereas, the recent steps being
taken by the majority Congress to
enact laws that ban church burning
through its legislative empowerment are commendable, but serve no
real remedy for worshippers and
communities whose churches have
already been burned to the ground;
and
Whereas,
this
Council
views
church burning as a very serious,
national health and safety crisis, as
innocent lives are threatened each
time a church is set afire; and
Whereas, the recent explosion of
church burnings brings to mind the
burning and bombing of churches in
the 1960s, where 3 innocent little
black girls were killed, where families’ dreams were destroyed, and
where communities burst into violence; and
Whereas, it has been well stated
that “without a watchful eye, history will certainly repeat itself”; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that it is paramount that citizens of these United
States feel free to worship without
threat of being killed during worship; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the U.S. Justice Department to move
swiftly and utilize all available
resources to identify the perpetrators of the recent surge of church
burnings.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the U.S. Congress to establish Community Reinvestment Act monies
and to establish a source of federal
funding through grants and low
interest loans for rebuilding churches that were and are burned by perpetrators of hate crimes.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

June 26, 1996
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution urging
the Administration to implement
tough enforcement of the City’s curfew laws and to fund additional programs for minors after school and
during the summer.
Whereas, the City’s neighborhoods
continue to experience serious problems from minors wandering the
streets in violation of the City’s curfew laws; and
Whereas, on June 10, 1996, this
Council passed Ordinance No. 183195, which toughens the City’s “nighttime” curfew laws in a manner similar to the City’s “daytime” curfew
laws; and
Whereas, these laws, among other
things, place a duty on parents to
take reasonable steps to insure that
their children are in school and to
prohibit their children from being
on the streets during the curfew
hours; and
Whereas, these laws can only be
effective,
however,
if
they
are
enforced; and
Whereas, with hot summer days
approaching, it is imperative that
the police increase activities to keep
minors off the streets in violation of
the City’s curfew laws; and
Whereas,
the
Administration
should provide additional programs
for minors after school and during
the
summer,
giving
priority
to
neighborhoods that lack existing
programs, in order to provide activities for these minors; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that strict
enforcement of the City’s curfew
laws can result in a safer, more
peaceful summer for us all; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Administration to
implement tough enforcement of the
City’s curfew laws in order to keep
minors off the streets and out of
trouble during curfew hours.
Section 2. That this Council further urges the Administration to
fund additional programs for minors
after school and during the summer,
giving priority to neighborhoods
that lack existing programs, in
order to provide our youths with an
outlet for their energies and to keep
them off the streets.
Section 3. That this resolution is

Museum of Science and Technology
to enter into a pre-hiring recognition agreement with the ticketsellers and projectionists at the
museum and a project labor agreement with the Building Trades
Council and the Service Employees
Union for future maintenance and

Whereas, more than most cities,
the City of Cleveland has benefited
from the achievements of union
labor; and
Whereas, this City Council places
a high value on the right of workers
to
collectively
bargain
for
wages and benefits; and
Whereas, practically all of the
development in Cleveland that has
contributed so greatly to the City’s
revival was performed by union
labor; and
Whereas, this Council has supported the efforts of the Great
Lakes Museum of Science and Technology to establish a memorable
attraction on the City’s lakefront;
and
Whereas, the upcoming opening
of the museum is a time for the City
to celebrate; and
Whereas, it is the wish of this
Council that the members of the
City’s unions benefit from the jobs
that will be available with the opening of this museum; and
Whereas, it is the belief of this
Council that the ticketsellers and
projectionists at the museum should
receive
a
pre-hiring
recognition
agreement; and
Whereas,
this
Council
further
believes that the operators of the
museum should negotiate a project
labor agreement with the Building
Trades Council and the Service
Employees Union for all future
repairs and maintenance of the
facility; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that the protection of the rights of union labor in
Cleveland will benefit all of our citizens; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Lakes Museum of Science and Technology to enter into a pre-hiring
recognition agreement with the ticketsellers and projectionists at the

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to enact
a deposit law for glass bottles and
requesting the Council President to
arrange a meeting between the
Cuyahoga County delegates to the
Ohio Assembly and the sponsors of
this legislation.
Whereas, the retail sale of certain
beverages in breakable glass containers which are improperly disposed of when empty has resulted
in such a proliferation of broken
glass in and upon the streets, parks,
and other public grounds of the City
of Cleveland and other major cities
throughout the State of Ohio, as to
render said public grounds dangerous to the citizens and particularly
to the children of this State; and
Whereas, the problem of broken
glass caused by improper disposal
of empty beverage bottles poses a
serious health and safety problem;
and
Whereas, it is virtually impossible
to recycle glass once it is broken
and it is virtually impossible to
remove
all
broken
glass
from
grassy areas in parks and recreational areas; and
Whereas, establishing an incentive or rewards program for the
recycling of glass bottles is one
means available to combat the problem of broken glass littering streets,
sidewalks, parks, and other public
areas of the City, and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
health, safety, and welfare of the
citizens of the State of Ohio; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly to enact
a deposit law for glass bottles.

Council is requested forthwith to
arrange a meeting between the

law for glass bottles in the State of
Ohio.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to each of
the Cuyahoga County delegates to
the General Assembly, as well as to
the President of the Ohio Senate and

12
the Speaker of the Ohio House of
Representatives.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

Section 457.04 Signs
(a) Purpose. The regulations of
this
section
are
established
to
ensure that licensed parking facilities are furnished with signs which
provide customers with accurate,
useful,
and
legible
information
regarding rates and other operational matters. Furthermore, these
regulations
are
established
to
ensure provision of signs which
clearly
and
effectively
identify
parking available to visitors seeking daily or other short-term parking. The requirement for provision
of such visitor-oriented signage is
intended to promote economic activity in the City by facilitating easy
access to parking which serves the
Central Business District and major
visitor attractions.
(b) Display of Rates and Other
Information. The following regulations shall apply to all parking lots
and garages subject to licensing
regulations.
(1) Display of Rates. Each parking facility shall be furnished with
signs readable from each vehicular

shall be a minimum height of 5
inches for dollar amounts and 3
inches for display of cents and other
rate information. For garages, rates
and rate information displayed on
or adjacent to booths and ticket dispensers shall have a minimum character height of 2 inches.

For a surface lot or for a garage
which is set back from the street,
the sign displaying the required
rate information shall be placed so
that the rates are visible and readable to the motorist prior to entering the property. For a garage
entrance located at the sidewalk
edge, such sign shall be placed so
that the rates are readable to the
motorist prior to passing the ticket
dispenser or attendant’s booth.
(3) Required Information. In addition to the rate information required
in division (b)(1) of this section,
each parking facility shall display
the following items of information:

at all attendant's booths, all payment boxes and/or at all vehicular
entrances.
(4) Destination Information. The
sign(s)
identifying
the
parking
facility and/or its rates, as required
in division (b)(1) of this section,
may also display information identifying businesses or other uses
served by the parking facility. Such
information shall be displayed in
lettering no more than 5 inches in
height and shall be incorporated
within the standard-size sign, as
permitted in this section.
(c) Special Event and Other Special Rate Parking.
Information regarding flat rates
for special event parking or other
special time-period parking, such as
“early bird specials,” shall be displayed in accordance with the following regulations. Such sign may
also be used to indicate that the
garage is “full.”
(1) Such rate information shall be
displayed on the permanent freestanding sign or signs which identify the parking facility’s regular
rates, using changeable panels or
electronically-changeable copy, in
accordance with design standards
adopted by the City Planning Commission.
(2) In the case of a garage which
is not served by a free-standing rate
sign, the special event or other special time-period parking rate may
be displayed on a metal or plastic
panel, mounted on a pole which is
inserted into a base which is permanently affixed to the ground.
Such sign shall be a maximum of
six (6) square feet in area and four
(4) feet in height above the ground
and shall not project into the public right-of-way.

attendant’s booth, ticket machine or
payment box, a sign placed on a
canopy or marquee, or a sign mounted above a fence post or pier.
Portable
signs
(i.e.,
“sandwich
boards” and other signs not permanently affixed to the ground or to a
permitted structure) shall not be
permitted, except as permitted in
division (c)(2) of this section.
(2) Location of Signs. No freestanding sign, nor any portion of
such sign, shall be located within or

except as permitted in division
(e)(1) of this section for a sign element displaying the international
parking symbol. No sign projecting
from a building wall shall extend to
a point which is within two (2) feet
of the outer edge of a street curb
nor shall such sign extend more
than five (5) feet from the building
wall.
(3) Vertical Clearance. No portion

or other pedestrian walking area
shall be located less than eight (8)
feet above the surface of such area.
No portion or a sign located above
a driveway or other vehicular way
shall be located less than sixteen
(16) feet above the surface of such
area.
(4) Primary and Secondary Signs.
As used in this section, the terms
“primary
signs”
and
“secondary
signs” shall have the following
meanings. “Primary signs” are a
parking facility’s principal signs
identifying
the
parking
facility
and/or its rates. A primary sign
may display other permitted information in addition to the identification and rate information. “Secondary signs” are signs which display only directional and instructional messages necessary to guide
motorists and pedestrians within
the parking facility. Signs which
provide detailed rate information,
supplementing that provided on the
primary signs, shall also be considered secondary signs.
(5) Size, Number and Height of
Signs. Each parking facility shall
be permitted a total of thirty-two
(32) square feet of “primary sign”
area for each vehicular entrance,
except that two vehicular entrances
located less than thirty (30) feet
apart, as measured along the property line, shall be counted as a single entrance for this purpose. Such
primary sign area permitted for
each entrance may be displayed on
either one or two sign structures. If
two sign structures are used, rate
information must be readable at
each vehicular entrance. No single
primary sign shall exceed thirty-two
(32) square feet in area nor shall it
exceed fifteen (15) feet in height if
free-standing. “Secondary signs,” if
free-standing, shall not exceed six
(6) square feet in area nor four (4)
feet in height, and shall be placed,
as approved by the City Planning
Director, only where necessary to
provide instructions to customers of
the
parking
facility.
Secondary

28
signs displayed on building walls or
on overhead structures shall be no
larger than necessary to display
permitted information in a readable
manner, as determined by the City
Planning Director.
(6) Measurement of Sign Area.
Only one side of double-sided signs
shall be counted in the measurement of sign area if the two sides
are
in
parallel,
back-to-back
arrangement.
(d)(7) Temporary Signs. For a
newly-established license parking
facility, the following temporary
signs shall be permitted for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days following the opening of the parking
facility:
A. signs substituting for approved
but
not-yet-installed
permanent
signs, conforming, to the maximum
extent feasible, with all regulations
and design standards for permanent
signs except those pertaining to fabrication materials; and
B. for each vehicular entrance,
one
wall-mounted
banner,
not
exceeding forty (40) square feet in
area, or one free-standing temporary
sign, not exceeding ten (10) square
feet in area, announcing the opening of the parking facility.
(e)
Signs
for
Visitor-Oriented
Parking Facilities. In addition to
other applicable regulations of this
section, the following supplemental
regulations shall apply to signs for
parking facilities which are available to the general public on a
hourly, daily or special event basis
(i.e., “visitor-oriented parking facilities”). These supplemental regulations shall not apply to parking
facilities which are restricted to use
by employees, residents, faculty or
students of businesses, institutions
or other buildings served by the
parking facility nor shall these regulations apply to parking facilities
which are restricted exclusively to
use on a weekly or monthly basis.
(1) Use of the International Parking
Symbol.
All
visitor-oriented
parking facilities shall be furnished
with a sign or signs, visible from
each vehicular entrance, displaying
the international parking symbol,
displayed as a white letter “P” at
least 14 inches in height, placed on
a purple (PMS #2685) circular background, a minimum of 22 inches in
diameter. The design shall be in
accordance with design standards
adopted by the City Planning Commission. In the case of a free-standing sign, the parking symbol may
project over a public sidewalk,
extending no more than thirty (30)
inches beyond the property line and
maintaining a minimum vertical
clearance of eight (8) feet. No other
element of such sign may project
over the public sidewalk.
(2) Design Standards. The City
Planning Commission shall adopt
and disseminate design standards
which, through use of narrative
materials and illustrations, describe
and depict signs which conform to
the requirements of this section
applicable to signs for visitor-oriented parking facilities. The standards shall also provide supplemental information on such design elements as color, materials, illumination, methods of attachment, border
areas, positioning of information
items, etc.
(3) Approval Process. The Director of the City Planning Commission
shall determine whether a proposed
sign for a visitor-oriented parking
facility meets the requirements of
this section and the adopted design

The City Record
standards, and shall approve or disapprove each application on that
basis. In the case of a proposed sign
which does not meet the requirements of this section, the City Planning Commission may approve the
sign if it determines that such sign
meets the standards of division
(e)(7) of this section.
(4) Comprehensive Sign Systems
for Large-Scale Facilities. In the
case of a large-scale complex of
facilities served by a network of
parking lots or garages under common management, the City Planning
Commission
may
approve
signs
which differ from the standards
established in this section as necessary to create a uniform series of
signs which identify parking facilities serving such complex.
(5) Replacement of Nonconforming
Signs.
For
parking
signs
installed prior to the initial effective date of this ordinance, any such
signs which do not conform to the
applicable regulations of this section shall be replaced by conforming signs in accordance with the following schedule, except as provided

457.035, and for parking facilities
located in the area directly north of
the Downtown Lakefront Parking
District, all nonconforming signs
shall be replaced or removed by
August 1, 1997, except that any nonconforming sign installed pursuant
to a Building Permit issued between
June 1, 1991 and May 31, 1996, shall
be replaced or removed by August
1, 1998.
B. For parking facilities located

within the remainder of the City, all
nonconforming
signs
shall
be

replacement is required under the
provisions of division (e)(5), any
owner wishing to retain such sign
shall submit a written request to
the City Planning Commission no
later than six (6) months prior to
the date on which replacement is
required.

place, a sketch showing the sign’s
dimensions
and
its
approximate
location on the property, and color
photographs of the sign. The City
Planning Commission shall, within
two (2) months of receipt, approve
retention of the sign if it determines
that such sign meets the standards
of division (e)(7) of this section.
(7) Standards for Approval of
Nonconforming Signs. With respect
to an application for the installation
or retention of a sign which does
not conform to the regulations of
this section, the City Planning Commission shall approve such application if its determines that the sign,
either alone or in combination with
other signs, provides information
which is sufficient to fulfill the stated purposes of this section, and that
the sign meets the following standards, as applicable:
A. the sign is attached to the wall

1278

June 26, 1996
of a building and is better suited to
the design of such building than a
conforming sign would be, or
B. the sign meets a higher standard of design quality than would
result from minimal conformance to
the standards of this section, or
C. the sign has been designed so
that it is more appropriate to its
environs or the uses which it serves
than a conforming sign would be, or
D. the sign is part of a comprehensive signage system for a largescale complex of facilities, and such
system meets the standards of division (e)(4), and
E. in the case of a new sign, the
deviation from the otherwise applicable regulations of this section is
the minimum necessary to meet one
or more of the special standards
established for approval of nonconforming signs.
(f) Application. Plans for installation of signs regulated in this section shall be submitted to the City
Planning Director either prior to or
concurrently with submission of any
required Building Permit application. The plans shall be sufficient
to demonstrate compliance with all
regulations of this section and with
the design standards adopted by the
City Planning Commission pursuant
to the provisions of this section. No
signs regulated in this section shall
be installed before approval by the
City Planning Director and issuance
of any required Building Permit.

Ord. No. 938-96.
By Councilmen Coats and Rokakis
(by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance providing for the issuance and sale of
bonds in the maximum principal
amount of $18,605,000 for the purpose of providing funds to improve
the municipal street system and
related facilities, to pay capitalized
interest and to pay all expenses
incurred in connection with the
issuance of the bonds; to authorize
agreements with respect to the
bonds; and to authorize the issuance
of notes in anticipation of such
bonds.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Eighteen
Million Six Hundred and Five Thousand
Dollars
($18,605,000)
(the
“Bonds”) to finance the cost of certain
permanent
improvements
described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five years and the maximum maturity of the Bonds is nineteen (19)
years; and
Whereas,
this
Council
passed
Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8,
1980, and thereafter amended that
ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed on May 6, 1983 (Ordinance
No. 1749-80, as so amended and as
the same may further be amended
from time to time in accordance
with its provisions, is referred to as
the “General Bond Ordinance”), providing the general terms and provisions for the issuance thereunder of
unvoted general obligations of the
City and the General Bond Ordinance was passed in contemplation
of this Ordinance and other ordinances authorizing the issuance of
bonds in accordance with the provisions thereof (the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to pay the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1, which are urgently needed
for the benefit of the City, and as

1286

a result, this Ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing
for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, property, health
and safety, and for the usual daily
operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed Eighteen Million Six Hundred and Five Thousand Dollars
($18,605,000) for the purpose of providing funds to improve the municipal street system and related facilities,
including
streets,
expressways,
roadways,
driveways
and
pedestrian walkways, by acquiring,
constructing, reconstructing, opening, extending, widening, grading,
draining, paving, lighting and curbing, installing gutters, sidewalks
and
related
pedestrian
improvements, resetting and constructing
catch
basins
and
other
storm
drainage
facilities,
constructing,
reconstructing, renovating and rehabilitating bridges, acquiring any
real estate and interests in real
estate, including easements, necessary for such purpose and installing
signs, signals, markings and other
devices for traffic control purposes,
together with off-street parking lot
improvements to facilitate the flow
of traffic, and together with the
payment of all associated preliminary and computerization costs and
costs of site clearance and all
appurtenances necessary and incidental thereto, and to pay all
expenses incurred in connection
with the issuance of the Bonds,
including any financing costs within the meaning of Revised Code Section 133.01(K), and to pay capitalized interest and such other costs of
the foregoing permanent improvements that may be financed with
the proceeds of securities as permitted by Revised Code Section
133.15(B) and as otherwise permitted by law; and to authorize the
issuance of notes in anticipation of
such bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated
“Bridges
and
Roadways
Improvement Bonds, Series 1996”.
The Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
July 1, 1996 or such other date, but
in no event later than December 31,
1996, specified in the certificate of
award providing for the final terms
of the Bonds and the sale of the
Bonds and signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate of nine percent
(9%) per year or at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then

June 26, 1996
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on March 1
and September 1 of each year or on
the first day of each of two months
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on
the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning September 1, 1996 or on such
other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature on September 1 in nineteen (19) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning September 1, 1996, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date (hereinafter defined), (ii) the
first
principal
payment
on
the
Bonds shall be no earlier than September 1, 1996 and no later than
August 1, 1998, (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than nineteen (19) years from
the first principal payment date,
and (iv) the principal amount thereof shall be payable in annual
installments such that the total
principal and interest payments on
the Bonds in any fiscal year in
which principal is payable is not
more than three times the amount
of those payments in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit

The City Record
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the
principal
amount
thereof
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation). Any excess
of that amount over the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement shall be
credited against subsequent Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligations)
in the order directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, provided that the earliest
date for such optional redemption
shall be no later than the tenth
anniversary of the first principal
payment date and the maximum
redemption price shall be no greater
than 102% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued interest to
the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption

1287

37
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the

38
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held by the Registrar for the
redemption
of
particular
Bonds
shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
thereof and shall be paid to them,
respectively, upon presentation and
surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the fifteenth day of the calendar
month next preceding that Interest
Payment Date (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are held
by a Depository in a book entry system (as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the
United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued

The City Record
pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee. The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor
and
by
the
City’s
Director
of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council. The Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust

1288

June 26, 1996
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Bonds in accordance with the provisions
of
this
ordinance.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Bonds issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this ordinance, as the Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants
or otherwise, a book entry system
to record ownership of beneficial
interests in Bonds or the principal
and interest, and to effect transfers
of Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and

June 26, 1996
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the form
of a single, fully registered Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository and any other arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall
permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
such Trustees, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
by such Account, shall be sold to
Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal

The City Record
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of Law
and other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript or proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the
Clerk,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this Ordinance
and not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those officers in their official capacities are authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of

1289

39
the City an Official Statement and
any necessary supplements thereto,
and on behalf of the City to use and
distribute, or authorize the use and
distribution of, that Official Statement and any supplements thereto
in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, and each of
those officers is authorized to sign
on behalf of the City and in his or
her official capacity, that Official
Statement
and
any
supplements
thereto approved by such officer.
Those officers are and each of them
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements thereto as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate.
Such officers are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of
the occurrence of any other events,
the Director of Finance shall consult with, as appropriate, the legal
counsel and bond or other qualified
independent special counsel to the
City. The Director of Finance, acting in the name and on behalf of
the City, shall be entitled to rely
upon any legal advice provided by
any such counsel in determining
whether a filing should be made.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be
designated
“Various
Purpose
General Obligation Bonds, Series
1996”. Such bonds shall contain a
summary
statement
of
purposes
encompassing the purpose for which
the Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.

Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended
and
applied
for
the
objects and purposes for which the
Bonds are issued. Accrued interest
and any premium received from the
sale of the Bonds shall be deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund to be applied to the payment
of the principal of and interest on
the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General Bond Ordinance and, in addition
to the taxes and revenues specifically pledged pursuant to this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds, the City hereby determines,
declares, warrants and covenants

The City Record
that the Bonds are general obligations of the City and that the full
faith and credit of the City are hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds in accordance with the laws
and Constitution of the State of
Ohio, this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations of the United States certified
by an independent public accounting firm of national reputation to be
of such maturities and interest payment dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or
reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be
sufficient, together with moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on
the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be,
or if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the
holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for

1290

June 26, 1996
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance for unclaimed funds held by
a Paying Agent. In the event of
nonpresentment of any Bond as
described in Section 17(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section
shall be held and paid as provided
in said Section 17(a) for unclaimed
funds held by a Paying Agent.
Section
9.
Bond
Anticipation
Notes. For the purpose of raising
money
in
anticipation
of
the
issuance of the Bonds for the purposes set forth in Section 1 hereof,
notes of the City may be issued in
an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed Eighteen Million Six Hundred and Five Thousand Dollars
($18,605,000) (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance
to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of the
Notes and the sale of the Notes and
signed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
Section 10. Term of the Notes. The
Notes: shall bear interest at such
rate, not exceeding nine per cent
(9%) per year, as may be fixed by
the Director of Finance of the City
in the Note Certificate of Award;
shall
be
dated
their
date
of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award, which shall be no later than
five (5) years from such date of
issuance; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of the
financial advisor of the City, determines that it is in the best interest
of the City in order to enhance the
marketability of the Notes, the
Director of Finance may cause the
Notes to not be redeemable for a
period which ends no later than the
date which is two (2) years following the date of issuance of the
Notes; shall be designated “Bridges
and Roadways Improvement Bond
Anticipation
Notes,
Series
1996”;
shall be issued in such numbers and
denominations as may be requested
by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter
defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be
in a book entry only system) in
denominations of $5,000 or integral
multiples thereof. Interest shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; provided that if the Notes
mature on or before the end of the
twelfth (12th) month following their
date of issuance, interest on the
Notes shall be payable at maturity.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the Registrar);
provided that the Escrow Agent
also shall act as paying agent for
the Notes so long as the Notes are
held in a book entry system. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among
the City, the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent (the Note Registrar
Agreement) providing for services
relating to the registration, transfer,
exchange and payment of Notes.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Note Registrar Agreement from the
proceeds of the Notes to the extent
available
and
then
from
other

June 26, 1996
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Notes as provided in
this Section (the Note Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Note
is registered on the Note Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Note for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Note shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Note, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose Gener-

The City Record
al
Obligation
Bond

purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be

facsimile.
Such
Notes
shall
express upon their face the purpose
for which they are issued and that
they are issued pursuant to this
ordinance, and may be payable in
Federal Reserve funds of the United States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate
of Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold
to Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc., and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (the “Note

sale shall be paid into the proper
fund and used for the purpose for
which the Notes are being issued
under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City

1291

41
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or

this Ordinance and the General
Bond Ordinance shall not apply to
the Bonds or the Notes authorized
herein.

it will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may

and the Bonds will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii) be treated
other than as bonds to which Section 103(a) of the Code applies, and
(b) the interest thereon will not be
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain

will not take or authorize to be
taken
any
actions
that

among other acts of compliance, (i)
apply the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records
and make calculations and reports,
and (v) refrain from certain uses of

the same may further be amended
from time to time in accordance
with its provisions, is referred to as
the “General Bond Ordinance”), providing the general terms and provisions for the issuance thereunder of
unvoted general obligations of the
City and the General Bond Ordinance was passed in contemplation
of this Ordinance and other ordinances authorizing the issuance of
bonds in accordance with the provisions thereof (the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to pay the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1, which are urgently needed
for the benefit of the City, and as
a result, this Ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing
for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, property, health
and safety, and for the usual daily
operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed One Million One Hundred
and
Thirty

areas by opening, widening, grading, draining, curbing and paving
designated
streets,
constructing
sidewalks, curbs and gutters and
driveway
approaches,
installing
storm and sanitary sewers, water
lines and storm drainage facilities
as necessary and installing street
lighting and signs, signals, markings and other devices for traffic

June 26, 1996
incurred in connection with the
issuance of the Bonds, including
any financing costs within the
meaning of Revised Code Section
133.01(K), and for paying capitalized interest and such other costs of
the foregoing permanent improvements that may be financed with
the proceeds of securities as permitted by Revised Code Section
133.15(B) and as otherwise permitted by law; and to authorize the
issuance of notes in anticipation of
such bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated “Residential Areas Improvement Bonds, Series 1996”. The Bonds
shall be issued in one lot as fully
registered Bonds in denominations
of $5,000 or any integral multiple
thereof. The Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
July 1, 1996 or such other date, but
in no event later than December 31,
1996, specified in the certificate of
award providing for the final terms
of the Bonds and the sale of the
Bonds and signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate of nine percent
(9%) per year or at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on March 1
and September 1 of each year or on
the first day of each of two months
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on
the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning September 1, 1996 or on such
other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature on September 1 in twenty (20) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning September 1, 1996, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date (hereinafter defined), (ii) the
first
principal
payment
on
the
Bonds shall be no earlier than September 1, 1996 and no later than
August 1, 1998, (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than twenty (20) years from
the first principal payment date,
and (iv) the principal amount thereof shall be payable in annual
installments such that the total
principal and interest payments on
the Bonds in any fiscal year in
which principal is payable is not
more than three times the amount
of those payments in any other fiscal year.

The City Record
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the
principal
amount
thereof
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory

1293

43
redemption obligation). Any excess
of that amount over the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement shall be
credited against subsequent Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligations)
in the order directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, provided that the earliest
date for such optional redemption
shall be no later than the tenth
anniversary of the first principal
payment date and the maximum
redemption price shall be no greater
than 102% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued interest to
the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for

44
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held by the Registrar for the
redemption
of
particular
Bonds
shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
thereof and shall be paid to them,
respectively, upon presentation and
surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Pay-

The City Record
ment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the fifteenth day of the calendar
month next preceding that Interest
Payment Date (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are held
by a Depository in a book entry system (as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the
United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee. The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor
and
by
the
City’s
Director
of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially

1294

June 26, 1996
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council. The Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred,
the City shall sign and the Registrar shall authenticate and deliver Bonds in accordance with the
provisions of this ordinance. The
exchange
or transfer shall
be
without
charge
to
the
owner,
except that the City and Registrar
may make a charge sufficient to
reimburse them for any tax or
other
governmental
charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City

June 26, 1996
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants
or otherwise, a book entry system
to record ownership of beneficial
interests in Bonds or the principal
and interest, and to effect transfers
of Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the form
of a single, fully registered Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the bene-

The City Record
ficial owners by the then Depository and any other arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall
permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
such Trustees, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
by such Account, shall be sold to
Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of Law
and other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and
procedure, and conditions for the
delivery of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and certificates, to cause
a true transcript or proceedings
with reference to the issuance of
the Bonds to be delivered to the
Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and

1295

45
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the
Clerk,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this Ordinance
and not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those officers in their official capacities are authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of
the City an Official Statement and
any necessary supplements thereto,
and on behalf of the City to use and
distribute, or authorize the use and
distribution of, that Official Statement and any supplements thereto
in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, and each of
those officers is authorized to sign
on behalf of the City and in his or
her official capacity, that Official
Statement
and
any
supplements
thereto approved by such officer.
Those officers are and each of them
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements thereto as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate.
Such officers are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including pro-

46
visions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of
the occurrence of any other events,
the Director of Finance shall consult with, as appropriate, the legal
counsel and bond or other qualified
independent special counsel to the
City. The Director of Finance, acting in the name and on behalf of
the City, shall be entitled to rely
upon any legal advice provided by
any such counsel in determining
whether a filing should be made.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be
designated
“Various
Purpose
General Obligation Bonds, Series
1996”. Such bonds shall contain a
summary
statement
of
purposes
encompassing the purpose for which
the Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this

or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be

date which is two (2) years following the date of issuance of the
Notes; shall be designated “Residential Areas Improvement Bond
Anticipation
Notes,
Series
1996”;
shall be issued in such numbers and

Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the Registrar);
provided that the Escrow Agent
also shall act as paying agent for
the Notes so long as the Notes are
held in a book entry system. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among
the City, the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent (the Note Registrar
Agreement) providing for services
relating to the registration, transfer,
exchange and payment of Notes.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Note Registrar Agreement from the
proceeds of the Notes to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Notes as provided in
this Section (the Note Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Note
is registered on the Note Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Note for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Note shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Note, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
principal corporate trust office of

The City Record
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City.
In all cases of Notes exchanged or
transferred, the City shall sign and
the Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver Notes in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance. The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Notes issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this ordinance, as the Notes
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General
Obligation

Anticipation

contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a
facsimile.
Such
Notes
shall
express upon their face the purpose
for which they are issued and that
they are issued pursuant to this
ordinance, and may be payable in
Federal Reserve funds of the United States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of

for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or

(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain

will not take or authorize to be
taken
any
actions
that

among other acts of compliance, (i)
apply the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records
and make calculations and reports,

and (iv) the principal amount thereof shall be payable in annual
installments such that the total
principal and interest payments on
the Bonds in any fiscal year in
which principal is payable is not
more than three times the amount
of those payments in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemp-

1299

49
tion Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the
principal
amount
thereof
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation). Any excess
of that amount over the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement shall be
credited against subsequent Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligations)
in the order directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, provided that the earliest
date for such optional redemption
shall be no later than the tenth
anniversary of the first principal
payment date and the maximum
redemption price shall be no greater
than 102% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued interest to
the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the

50
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,

The City Record
however, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held by the Registrar for the
redemption
of
particular
Bonds
shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
thereof and shall be paid to them,
respectively, upon presentation and
surrender of those Bonds. The debt
charges on the Bonds shall be
payable in lawful money of the
United States of America without
deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the fifteenth day of the calendar
month next preceding that Interest
Payment Date (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are held
by a Depository in a book entry system (as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the
United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included

1300

June 26, 1996
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee. The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor
and
by
the
City’s
Director
of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council. The Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall

June 26, 1996
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Bonds in accordance with the provisions
of
this
ordinance.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Bonds issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this ordinance, as the Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities

The City Record
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants
or otherwise, a book entry system
to record ownership of beneficial
interests in Bonds or the principal
and interest, and to effect transfers
of Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the form
of a single, fully registered Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository and any other arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall
permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
such Trustees, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
by such Account, shall be sold to
Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital

1301

51
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of Law
and other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript or proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the
Clerk,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this Ordinance
and not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Bond Purchase Agreement or

52
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those officers in their official capacities are authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of
the City an Official Statement and
any necessary supplements thereto,
and on behalf of the City to use and
distribute, or authorize the use and
distribution of, that Official Statement and any supplements thereto
in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, and each of
those officers is authorized to sign
on behalf of the City and in his or
her official capacity, that Official
Statement
and
any
supplements
thereto approved by such officer.
Those officers are and each of them
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements thereto as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate.
Such officers are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of
the occurrence of any other events,
the Director of Finance shall consult with, as appropriate, the legal
counsel and bond or other qualified
independent special counsel to the
City. The Director of Finance, acting in the name and on behalf of
the City, shall be entitled to rely

The City Record
upon any legal advice provided by
any such counsel in determining
whether a filing should be made.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be
designated
“Various
Purpose
General Obligation Bonds, Series
1996”. Such bonds shall contain a
summary
statement
of
purposes
encompassing the purpose for which
the Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended
and
applied
for
the
objects and purposes for which the
Bonds are issued. Accrued interest
and any premium received from the
sale of the Bonds shall be deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund to be applied to the payment

1302

June 26, 1996
of the principal of and interest on
the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General Bond Ordinance and, in addition
to the taxes and revenues specifically pledged pursuant to this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds, the City hereby determines,
declares, warrants and covenants
that the Bonds are general obligations of the City and that the full
faith and credit of the City are hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds in accordance with the laws
and Constitution of the State of
Ohio, this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations of the United States certified
by an independent public accounting firm of national reputation to be
of such maturities and interest payment dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or
reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be
sufficient, together with moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on
the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be,
or if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of

June 26, 1996
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the
holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance for unclaimed funds held by
a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment
of
any
Bond
as
described in Section 17(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section
shall be held and paid as provided
in said Section 17(a) for unclaimed
funds held by a Paying Agent.
Section

money
in
anticipation
of
the
issuance of the Bonds for the purposes set forth in Section 1 hereof,
notes of the City may be issued in
an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed Two Million Eight Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars
($2,860,000) (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance
to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of the
Notes and the sale of the Notes and
signed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
Section 10. Term of the Notes. The

(9%) per year, as may be fixed by
the Director of Finance of the City
in the Note Certificate of Award;

of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award, which shall be no later than
five (5) years from such date of

to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of the
financial advisor of the City, determines that it is in the best interest
of the City in order to enhance the
marketability of the Notes, the
Director of Finance may cause the
Notes to not be redeemable for a
period which ends no later than the
date which is two (2) years following the date of issuance of the
Notes; shall be designated “Public
Facilities Improvement Bond Anticipation Notes, Series 1996”; shall be
issued in such numbers and denominations as may be requested by the
Note
Purchaser
(hereinafter
defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be
in a book entry only system) in
denominations of $5,000 or integral
multiples thereof. Interest shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; provided that if the Notes
mature on or before the end of the
twelfth (12th) month following their
date of issuance, interest on the
Notes shall be payable at maturity.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the Registrar);
provided that the Escrow Agent
also shall act as paying agent for

The City Record
the Notes so long as the Notes are
held in a book entry system. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among
the City, the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent (the Note Registrar
Agreement) providing for services
relating to the registration, transfer,
exchange and payment of Notes.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Note Registrar Agreement from the
proceeds of the Notes to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money
lawfully
available
and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Notes as provided in
this Section (the Note Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Note
is registered on the Note Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Note for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Note shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Note, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before

1303

53
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General
Obligation
Bond
Anticipation
Notes, Series 1996”. The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a
facsimile.
Such
Notes
shall
express upon their face the purpose
for which they are issued and that
they are issued pursuant to this
ordinance, and may be payable in
Federal Reserve funds of the United States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate
of Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold
to Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc., and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (the “Note
Purchaser”). The proceeds of such
sale shall be paid into the proper
fund and used for the purpose for
which the Notes are being issued
under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds

54
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or
any other appropriate disclosure
document of the City in accordance
with the sale and delivery of the
Notes, and to deem such disclosure
document “final” for purposes of
SEC Rule 15c2-12.

Ordinances of the City which are
inconsistent with the provisions of
this Ordinance and the General
Bond Ordinance shall not apply to
the Bonds or the Notes authorized
herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance are fully applicable to the
Bonds and the Notes authorized
herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to alter or
restrict such full application of the

third paragraph of Section 4 of the

Section
18.
Federal
Tax
Covenants. The City covenants that
it will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the Notes
and the Bonds will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii) be treated
other than as bonds to which Section 103(a) of the Code applies, and
(b) the interest thereon will not be
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and (b) it
will not take or authorize to be
taken
any
actions
that
would
adversely affect that exclusion, and
(c) it, or persons acting for it, will,
among other acts of compliance, (i)
apply the proceeds of the Notes and

The City Record
the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records
and make calculations and reports,
and (v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds, and, as applicable,
of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Notes and
the Bonds is also made with respect
to all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Notes or the Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Notes
and the Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of

waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds
as the City is permitted or required

income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Notes and
the Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclusion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes
and the Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances
relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds.

Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated
“Recreational
Facilities
Improvement Bonds, Series 1996”.
The Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
July 1, 1996 or such other date, but
in no event later than December 31,
1996, specified in the certificate of
award providing for the final terms
of the Bonds and the sale of the
Bonds and signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate of nine percent
(9%) per year or at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on March 1
and September 1 of each year or on
the first day of each of two months
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on
the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning September 1, 1996 or on such
other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature on September 1 in twenty (20) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning September 1, 1996, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date (hereinafter defined), (ii) the
first
principal
payment
on
the
Bonds shall be no earlier than September 1, 1996 and no later than

1305

55
August 1, 1998, (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than twenty (20) years from
the first principal payment date,
and (iv) the principal amount thereof shall be payable in annual
installments such that the total
principal and interest payments on
the Bonds in any fiscal year in
which principal is payable is not
more than three times the amount
of those payments in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or pur-

56
chased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the
principal
amount
thereof
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation). Any excess
of that amount over the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement shall be
credited against subsequent Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligations)
in the order directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, provided that the earliest
date for such optional redemption
shall be no later than the tenth
anniversary of the first principal
payment date and the maximum
redemption price shall be no greater
than 102% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued interest to
the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000

The City Record
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held by the Registrar for the
redemption
of
particular
Bonds
shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
thereof and shall be paid to them,

1306

June 26, 1996
respectively, upon presentation and
surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the fifteenth day of the calendar
month next preceding that Interest
Payment Date (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are held
by a Depository in a book entry system (as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the
United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee. The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor
and
by
the
City’s
Director
of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to

June 26, 1996
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council. The Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of

The City Record
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Bonds in accordance with the provisions
of
this
ordinance.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Bonds issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this ordinance, as the Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants
or otherwise, a book entry system
to record ownership of beneficial
interests in Bonds or the principal
and interest, and to effect transfers
of Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the form
of a single, fully registered Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of

1307

57
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository and any other arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall
permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
such Trustees, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
by such Account, shall be sold to
Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of Law
and other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrange-

58
ments as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript or proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the
Clerk,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this Ordinance
and not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those officers in their official capacities are authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of
the City an Official Statement and
any necessary supplements thereto,
and on behalf of the City to use and
distribute, or authorize the use and
distribution of, that Official Statement and any supplements thereto
in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, and each of
those officers is authorized to sign
on behalf of the City and in his or
her official capacity, that Official
Statement
and
any
supplements
thereto approved by such officer.
Those officers are and each of them
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements thereto as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate.
Such officers are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time

The City Record
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of
the occurrence of any other events,
the Director of Finance shall consult with, as appropriate, the legal
counsel and bond or other qualified
independent special counsel to the
City. The Director of Finance, acting in the name and on behalf of
the City, shall be entitled to rely
upon any legal advice provided by
any such counsel in determining
whether a filing should be made.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be
designated
“Various
Purpose
General Obligation Bonds, Series
1996”. Such bonds shall contain a
summary
statement
of
purposes
encompassing the purpose for which
the Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio. The tax shall be
and is hereby ordered computed, certified, levied and extended upon the
tax duplicate and collected by the
same officers, in the same manner
and at the same time that taxes for
general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and
collected. The tax shall be placed
before and in preference to all other

1308

June 26, 1996
items and for the full amount thereof. The funds derived from the tax
levies hereby required shall be
placed in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to
the General Bond Ordinance which,
together with the interest collected
on the same, shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds
when and as the same fall due; provided, however, that, subject to the
provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in each year
to the extent that revenues are
available from other sources for the
payment of the Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such tax shall be reduced
by the amount of such revenues so
available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended
and
applied
for
the
objects and purposes for which the
Bonds are issued. Accrued interest
and any premium received from the
sale of the Bonds shall be deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund to be applied to the payment
of the principal of and interest on
the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General Bond Ordinance and, in addition
to the taxes and revenues specifically pledged pursuant to this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds, the City hereby determines,
declares, warrants and covenants
that the Bonds are general obligations of the City and that the full
faith and credit of the City are hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds in accordance with the laws
and Constitution of the State of
Ohio, this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and

June 26, 1996
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations of the United States certified
by an independent public accounting firm of national reputation to be
of such maturities and interest payment dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or
reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be
sufficient, together with moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on
the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be,
or if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the
holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance for unclaimed funds held by
a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment
of
any
Bond
as
described in Section 17(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section
shall be held and paid as provided
in said Section 17(a) for unclaimed
funds held by a Paying Agent.
Section

money
in
anticipation
of
the

act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the Registrar);
provided that the Escrow Agent
also shall act as paying agent for

office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Notes as provided in
this Section (the Note Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Note
is registered on the Note Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Note for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Note shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the con-

1309

59
trary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Note, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General
Obligation
Bond
Anticipation
Notes, Series 1996”. The Notes shall

purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a
facsimile.
Such
Notes
shall
express upon their face the purpose
for which they are issued and that
they are issued pursuant to this
ordinance, and may be payable in
Federal Reserve funds of the United States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale

60
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate

exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold
to Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc., and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (the “Note
Purchaser”). The proceeds of such
sale shall be paid into the proper
fund and used for the purpose for
which the Notes are being issued
under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax
annually not less than that which
would have been levied if bonds had
been issued therefor without the
prior issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or

document of the City in accordance
with the sale and delivery of the
Notes, and to deem such disclosure

the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property

Now, therefore, be it ordained by
the Council of the City of Cleveland,
Cuyahoga County, Ohio, that:
Whereas,
this
Council
passed
Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8,
1980, and thereafter amended that
ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed on May 6, 1983 (Ordinance
No. 1749-80, as so amended and as
the same may further be amended
from time to time in accordance
with its provisions, is referred to as
the “General Bond Ordinance”), providing the general terms and provisions for the issuance thereunder of
unvoted general obligations of the
City and the General Bond Ordinance was passed in contemplation
of this Ordinance and other ordinances authorizing the issuance of
bonds in accordance with the provisions thereof (the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to advance refund the Refunded
Bonds which will enable the City to
carry out certain amendments to
Sections 179.01 through 179.18 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City (the
“Sinking Fund Ordinance”) and the
General Bond Ordinance which are
urgently needed for the benefit of
the City, and as a result, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the immediate
preservation
of
the
public,
peace, property, health and safety,
and for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed Forty-Five Million Dollars
($45,000,000) for the purpose of
advance refunding the Refunded
Bonds
which,
collectively,
were
issued for the purposes of providing
funds to pay costs of Projects 1
through 26 as described above,
including
the
payment
of
any
expenses relating to the advance
refunding of the Refunded Bonds
and the issuance of the Bonds,
including all financing costs within
the meaning of Revised Code Section 133.15(B).
The aggregate principal amount
of Bonds to be issued shall not
exceed $45,000,000 and shall be in an
amount determined by the Director
of Finance to be the aggregate principal amount of Bonds that are
required to be issued, taking into
account
any
discount
from
the
aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds at which they are sold to the
Original Purchaser, in order to
effect the purpose for which the
Bonds are to be issued, including
the payment of any expenses relating to the advance refunding of the
Refunded Bonds and the issuance of

the Bonds, which amount shall be
set forth in the certificate providing
for the final terms of the Bonds and
the sale of the Bonds and signed by
the Director of Finance in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”). The Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that additional
maturities or different maturities of
the series of unvoted general obligation bonds of the City identified in
the preambles of this Ordinance and
issued for the purpose of providing
funds to pay costs of Projects 1
through 26 may be refunded and
thereby constitute Refunded Bonds;
provided that in adding or changing
such maturities the Director of
Finance determines, based on written advice from the City’s financial
advisor, that advance refunding
such maturities generates present
value debt service savings to the
City or otherwise is in the best
interests of the City, taking into
account all the factors that the
Director of Finance and the City’s
financial advisor deem relevant to
such determination.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Revised
Code Chapter 133 and other applicable provisions of the Revised Code,
the Charter of the City, the General Bond Ordinance and this Ordinance in the principal amount and
for the purpose stated in Section 1.
The Bonds shall be designated
“Refunding Bonds, Series 1996”. The
Bonds shall be issued in one lot as
fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof but in no case as to a
particular maturity date exceeding
the principal amount maturing on
that date. The Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
July 1, 1996 or such other date specified in the Certificate of Award,
but in no event later than December 31, 1996. The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate of nine percent
(9%) per year or at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on March 1
and September 1 of each year or on
the first day of each of two months
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on
the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning September 1, 1996, or on such
other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date. The
Bonds shall bear interest from the
most recent date to which interest
has been paid or provided for or, if
no interest has been paid or provided for, from their date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as
shall be determined by the Director
of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i)
each principal payment shall occur
on an Interest Payment Date, (ii)

1313

63
the first principal payment on the
Bonds shall be no earlier than September 1, 1996 and no later than September 1, 1998, (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than the last maturity permitted by law for the Refunded Bonds,
and (iv) the principal amount thereof shall be payable in annual
installments such that the total
principal and interest payments on
the Bonds in any fiscal year in
which principal is payable, is not
more than three times the amount
of those payments for the Refunded
Bonds in any fiscal year in which
principal
was
payable
on
the
Refunded Bonds.
The Director of Finance also shall
determine, in the Certificate of
Award or otherwise, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Bonds to
the Original Purchaser, that portion
of the aggregate principal amount
of the Bonds that is allocable to
each Project, and the principal
amount of Bonds allocated to each
Project that shall be payable annually at stated maturity or pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(as
defined below) on each principal
payment date; provided, that (i) the
aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds allocable to a Project shall
be determined by the Director of
Finance on a pro rata basis by reference to the respective amount of
funds that is required for the
advance refunding of the Refunded
Bonds that are allocable to that Project, taking into account any funds
other than the proceeds of the
Bonds that are available and appropriated for that purpose, (ii) no portion of the aggregate principal
amount of Bonds allocated to a Project shall be payable later than the
maximum maturity for that portion
of the Bonds as certified by the
Director of Finance, and (iii) a portion of the aggregate principal
amount of Bonds allocated to a Project shall be payable annually at
stated maturity or pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements on each principal
payment date on which the Director
of Finance determines in the Certificate of Award or otherwise that
principal of Bonds allocated to that
Project shall be payable.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to

64
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the
principal
amount
thereof
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation).
Any excess of that amount over
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
shall be credited against subsequent
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligations) in the order directed by the
Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, provided that the earliest
date for such optional redemption
shall be no later than the tenth
anniversary of the first principal
payment date and the maximum
redemption price shall be no greater
than 102% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued interest to
the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot

The City Record
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other
moneys available therefor and held
by the Registrar, will be sufficient
to redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address

1314

June 26, 1996
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held by the Registrar for the
redemption
of
particular
Bonds
shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
thereof and shall be paid to them,
respectively, upon presentation and
surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the fifteenth day of the calendar
month next preceding that Interest
Payment Date (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are held
by a Depository in a book entry system (as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the
United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not

June 26, 1996
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee. The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor
and
by
the
City’s
Director
of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent also shall act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council. The Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute

The City Record
owner of that Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Bonds in accordance with the provisions
of
this
ordinance.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Bonds issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this ordinance, as the Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance: “Book
entry form” or “book entry system”
means a form or system under
which (i) the ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds and the principal of and interest on the Bonds
may be transferred only through a
book entry, and (ii) physical Bond
certificates in fully registered form
are issued by the City only to a
Depository or its nominee as registered owner, with the Bonds “immobilized” in the custody of the Depository. The book entry maintained by
others than the City is the record

1315

65
that identifies the owners of beneficial interests in those Bonds and
that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities depository that is a clearing
agency under federal law operating
and maintaining, with its Participants or otherwise, a book entry
system to record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the
principal and interest, and to effect
transfers of Bonds, in book entry
form, and includes and means initially The Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the form
of a single, fully registered Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository and any other arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall
permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form

Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the
Clerk,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not

and not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of

The City Record
the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor

Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those officers in their official capacities are authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of
the City an Official Statement and

Such officers are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute an agreement made by the

City’s performance of that agreement shall be subject to the availability of funds and their annual
appropriation to meet costs the City
would be required to incur to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of
the occurrence of any other events,
the Director of Finance shall consult with, as appropriate, the legal
counsel and bond or other qualified
independent special counsel to the
City. The Director of Finance, acting in the name and on behalf of

1316

the City, shall be entitled to rely
upon any legal advice provided by
any such counsel in determining
whether a filing should be made.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be
designated
“Various
Purpose

summary
statement
of
purposes
encompassing the purpose for which
the Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.

falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on

each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,

Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance

(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:

The City Record
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the
principal
amount
thereof
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation). Any excess
of that amount over the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement shall be
credited against subsequent Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligations)
in the order directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, provided that the earliest
date for such optional redemption
shall be no later than the tenth
anniversary of the first principal
payment date and the maximum
redemption price shall be no greater

1319

69
than 102% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued interest to
the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are

70
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held by the Registrar for the
redemption
of
particular
Bonds
shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
thereof and shall be paid to them,
respectively, upon presentation and
surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the fifteenth day of the calendar
month next preceding that Interest
Payment Date (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are held
by a Depository in a book entry system (as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the
United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond

The City Record
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee. The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor
and
by
the
City’s
Director
of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council. The Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred
pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will

1320

June 26, 1996
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Bonds in accordance with the provisions
of
this
ordinance.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Bonds issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this ordinance, as the Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and

June 26, 1996
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants
or otherwise, a book entry system
to record ownership of beneficial
interests in Bonds or the principal
and interest, and to effect transfers
of Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the form
of a single, fully registered Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository and any other arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall
permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City

The City Record
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
such Trustees, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
by such Account, shall be sold to
Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of Law
and other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript or proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with

1321

71
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the
Clerk,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this Ordinance
and not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those officers in their official capacities are authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of
the City an Official Statement and
any necessary supplements thereto,
and on behalf of the City to use and
distribute, or authorize the use and
distribution of, that Official Statement and any supplements thereto
in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, and each of
those officers is authorized to sign
on behalf of the City and in his or
her official capacity, that Official
Statement
and
any
supplements
thereto approved by such officer.
Those officers are and each of them
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements thereto as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate.
Such officers are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, includ-

72
ing the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of
the occurrence of any other events,
the Director of Finance shall consult with, as appropriate, the legal
counsel and bond or other qualified
independent special counsel to the
City. The Director of Finance, acting in the name and on behalf of
the City, shall be entitled to rely
upon any legal advice provided by
any such counsel in determining
whether a filing should be made.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be
designated
“Various
Purpose
General Obligation Bonds, Series
1996”. Such bonds shall contain a
summary
statement
of
purposes
encompassing the purpose for which
the Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as
provided pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance which, together
with the interest collected on the
same, shall be irrevocably pledged
for the payment of principal of and
interest on the Bonds when and as
the same fall due; provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of
Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in each year to the extent
that revenues are available from
other sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.

The City Record
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended
and
applied
for
the
objects and purposes for which the
Bonds are issued. Accrued interest
and any premium received from the
sale of the Bonds shall be deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund to be applied to the payment
of the principal of and interest on
the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General Bond Ordinance and, in addition
to the taxes and revenues specifically pledged pursuant to this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds, the City hereby determines,
declares, warrants and covenants
that the Bonds are general obligations of the City and that the full
faith and credit of the City are hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds in accordance with the laws
and Constitution of the State of
Ohio, this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations of the United States certified
by an independent public accounting firm of national reputation to be
of such maturities and interest payment dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or
reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be
sufficient, together with moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on
the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be,

1322

June 26, 1996
or if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in

notes of the City may be issued in
an aggregate principal amount not

and
Fifty
Thousand
Dollars
($2,150,000) (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance
to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of the
Notes and the sale of the Notes and
signed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
Section 10. Term of the Notes. The

rate, not exceeding nine per cent
(9%) per year, as may be fixed by
the Director of Finance of the City
in the Note Certificate of Award;
shall

their
date
of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award, which shall be no later than
five (5) years from such date of
issuance; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of the
financial advisor of the City, determines that it is in the best interest
of the City in order to enhance the
marketability of the Notes, the
Director of Finance may cause the
Notes to not be redeemable for a
period which ends no later than the
date which is two (2) years following the date of issuance of the
Notes; shall be designated “Convention
Center
Improvement
Bond
Anticipation
Notes,
Series
1996”;
shall be issued in such numbers and
denominations as may be requested
by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter
defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be
in a book entry only system) in
denominations of $5,000 or integral
multiples thereof. Interest shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; provided that if the Notes

June 26, 1996
mature on or before the end of the
twelfth (12th) month following their
date of issuance, interest on the
Notes shall be payable at maturity.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the Registrar);
provided that the Escrow Agent
also shall act as paying agent for
the Notes so long as the Notes are
held in a book entry system. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among
the City, the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent (the Note Registrar
Agreement) providing for services
relating to the registration, transfer,
exchange and payment of Notes.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Note Registrar Agreement from the
proceeds of the Notes to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain
and keep at its principal corporate
trust office all books and records
necessary
for
the
registration,
exchange and transfer of Notes as
provided in this Section (the Note
Register). Subject to the provisions
of Section 5, the person in whose
name a Note is registered on the
Note Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Note for
all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Note shall be made
only to or upon the order of that
person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary, but the registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of

The City Record
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General
Obligation
Bond
Anticipation
Notes, Series 1996”. The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a
facsimile.
Such
Notes
shall
express upon their face the purpose
for which they are issued and that
they are issued pursuant to this
ordinance, and may be payable in
Federal Reserve funds of the United States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate
of Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold
to Merrill Lynch & Co., Key Capital
Markets, Inc., Banc One Capital Corporation, Huntington Capital Corp.,
NatCity Investments, Inc., and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (the “Note
Purchaser”). The proceeds of such
sale shall be paid into the proper
fund and used for the purpose for
which the Notes are being issued
under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby

1323

73
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or
any other appropriate disclosure
document of the City in accordance
with the sale and delivery of the
Notes, and to deem such disclosure
document “final” for purposes of
SEC Rule 15c2-12.

Ordinances of the City which are

this Ordinance and the General
Bond Ordinance shall not apply to
the Bonds or the Notes authorized
herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance are fully applicable to the

18.
Federal
Tax
Covenants. The City covenants that
it will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the Notes
and the Bonds will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii) be treated
other than as bonds to which Section 103(a) of the Code applies, and
(b) the interest thereon will not be
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for fed-

74
eral income tax purposes, and (b) it
will not take or authorize to be
taken
any
actions
that
would
adversely affect that exclusion, and
(c) it, or persons acting for it, will,
among other acts of compliance, (i)
apply the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records
and make calculations and reports,

of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Notes and
the Bonds is also made with respect
to all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Notes or the Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Notes
and the Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds.

for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Notes and
the Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclusion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes
and the Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all

be reduced by the refinancing of the
Series 1992 Bonds and that, therefore, it is necessary and in the best
interest of the City to advance
refund all of the City’s Series 1992
Bonds that remain outstanding (the
Refunded Bonds), to call for optional redemption on September 15, 2002
the Refunded Bonds that are stated
to mature after that date, and to
issue the bonds described in Section
3 of this ordinance (the Series 1996

with any other funds available to
the
City
for
that
purpose,
to
advance
refund
the
Refunded
Bonds, including the payment of
expenses relating to the advance
refunding of the Refunded Bonds or
the issuance of the Series 1996
Bonds, thereby reducing the financing costs of the 1992 Project;
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department and providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that the issuance
of the Series 1996 Bonds authorized
by this ordinance is needed to
enable the City to take advantage
of current favorable market conditions to refund the Refunded Bonds
and thereby reduce the financing
costs of the 1992 Project; now, therefore,

Section
2.
Determinations
by
Council. This Council finds and
determines as follows:
(a) Public Purpose. The Council
of the City found and determined at
the time of the issuance of the
Series 1992 Bonds, and hereby reaffirms, that: it was necessary for the
City to acquire, construct, improve,
rehabilitate and equip the municipal
parking facilities comprising the
1992 Project; the 1992 Project and
the issuance of the Series 1992
Bonds to pay costs of the 1992 Project, and the issuance of the Series
1996 Bonds to advance refund the
Series 1992 Bonds, served and serves
a proper public municipal purpose
by providing needed parking facilities to the people of the City, alleviating traffic congestion on the
streets of the City, thereby facilitating the movement of traffic, the
movement of police and fire vehicles in the City for the safety and
welfare of its citizens, and the
cleaning of the streets for the
health, safety and welfare of its citizens. The facilities comprising the
1992 Project are located in designated urban renewal areas of the
City, and the City’s completion of
the municipal facilities constituting
the 1992 Project in those urban
renewal areas, and the issuance of
the Series 1992 Bonds to pay costs
of the 1992 Project and the issuance
of the Series 1996 Bonds to advance
refund the Series 1992 Bonds, were
and will be undertaken for the elimination of conditions of blight determined to exist in those areas and to
prevent the reoccurrence of such
conditions of blight. The 1992 Project advances the economic welfare
of the City by increasing and promoting
commerce
by
providing
parking facilities for surrounding
businesses and other commercial
enterprises, and the 1992 Project creates and preserves jobs and employment opportunities in the City and
improves the economic welfare of
the City by maintaining and improving access to the City by the commuting public.
(b) Issuance of Series 1996 Bonds.
It is necessary and proper, expedient and in the best interest of the
City to, and the City shall, issue the
Series 1996 Bonds for the purpose of

June 26, 1996
providing funds to advance refund
the Refunded Bonds. The aggregate
principal amount of Series 1996
Bonds to be issued shall not exceed
$85,000,000, assuming that the Series
1996 Bonds are to be initially
offered to the public at a price at
least equal to one hundred percent
(100%) of their aggregate principal
amount, but, if any of the Series
1996 Bonds are to be initially
offered to the public at an original
issue discount, then the maximum
aggregate principal amount of the
Series 1996 Bonds hereby authorized, shall be increased over those
amounts by an amount equal to the
sum of the products obtained by
multiplying the original issue discount at which each Series 1996
Bond is to be initially offered to the
public, by the principal amount of
the Series 1996 Bond to be so
offered. Subject to the immediately
preceding sentence, the aggregate
principal amount of the Series 1996
Bonds shall be in an amount determined in the Certificate of Award to
be the aggregate principal amount
of Series 1996 Bonds that are
required to be issued, taking into
account any other funds available to
the City for the purpose, including
any moneys in the 1992 Funds that
are to be made available for the
advance refunding of the Refunded
Bonds in accordance with Section 9
of
this
ordinance,
in
order
to
advance
refund
the
Refunded
Bonds, to establish any reserves
required under the Indenture, to pay
expenses relating to that advance
refunding or the issuance of the
Series 1996 Bonds and otherwise to
effect the purpose for which the
Series 1996 Bonds are to be issued.
(c) Pledged Revenues. Bond Service Charges on the Series 1996
Bonds and any additional Bonds
issued under the Indenture shall be
payable from the Pledged Revenues
as defined and described in the
Indenture. The Pledged Revenues
generally shall include the fees,

City’s ownership or operation of onstreet parking facilities, and the

the
Indenture.

Bonds. It is necessary and in the
best interest of the City to advance
refund the Refunded Bonds and to

redemption

The Series 1996 Bonds shall, if not

Indenture, and shall be issued in
Authorized Denominations. Series

such manner as determined by the
Trustee in order to distinguish each
Series 1996 Bond from any other
Series 1996 Bond, shall be subject to
optional redemption in the amounts,
upon the conditions, and at the
times and prices, and may be subject to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption in the amounts and at

in or provided for by or pursuant to
the Bond Legislation and upon the
conditions set forth in the Indenture. Bond Service Charges on the

as to be set forth in the Certificate
of Award.
The Series 1996 Bonds may be
subject to redemption prior to stated maturity as follows:
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If requested by the Original
Purchaser and confirmed in the Certificate of Award, any annual principal maturity amount may be consolidated with one or more consecutive
preceding
annual
principal
maturity amounts into a single
aggregate principal amount maturing on that stated annual maturity
date. In that case, those Term Bonds
then maturing on that stated annual maturity date shall be subject to
Mandatory Redemption prior to stated maturity in part pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements, at a redemption price of
100%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed plus interest accrued to
the redemption date. Portions of the
Term Bonds shall be so redeemed on
the Principal Payment Date in each
of those preceding years and in the
respective
full
annual
principal
amounts listed in a principal maturity schedule set forth in the Certificate of Award for payment in
those preceding years (the Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements).
If retired only by Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption prior to their
stated maturity, the remaining principal amount of any Term Bonds

money to be deposited with the
Trustee in the Bond Service Fund

payment
of
Bond
Service
Charges
on
Term
Bonds
shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem the principal amount of
Term Bonds set forth opposite the
respective dates in the principal
maturity schedule set forth in the
Certificate
of
Award
(less
the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Trustee for cancellation Term Bonds in any aggregate
principal amount and to receive a
credit against any then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirement (and corresponding Mandatory
Redemption Obligation) as set forth
pursuant to the above for any Term
Bonds. That option shall be exercised by the City on or before the
45th day preceding the applicable
Mandatory Redemption date, by furnishing the Trustee a certificate,
signed by the Director of Finance,
setting forth the extent of the credit to be applied with respect to the
then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Requirement. If a certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Trustee,
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Requirement (and corresponding Mandatory Redemption Obligation) shall not be reduced. A credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Requirement (and
corresponding Mandatory Redemption
Obligation)
also
shall
be
received by the City for any Term
Bonds which prior thereto have
been redeemed (other than through
the operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and cancelled by the Trustee, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any Mandatory Redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased

82
and cancelled, shall be credited by
the Trustee at 100% of its principal
amount against the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirement (and corresponding Mandatory
Redemption Obligation). Any excess
of that amount over the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Requirement
shall
be
credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements (and corresponding
Mandatory
Redemption
Obligations) in the order directed
by the Director of Finance.
Optional Redemption. If determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award to be necessary or advisable to the sale of
the Series 1996 Bonds, the Series
1996 Bonds shall, as provided in the
Certificate of Award, be subject to
redemption by and at the option of
the City, in whole on any date or in
part on any Interest Payment Date,
in integral multiples of $5,000, at
the
redemption
prices
specified
(expressed as a percentage of the
principal amount redeemed), plus in
each case accrued interest to the
redemption date; provided that the
earliest optional redemption date
shall not be earlier than September
15, 2004, and the highest redemption
price shall not be greater than
102%.
If optional redemption of any
Term Bonds at a redemption price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption date provided for
pursuant to the above provisions,
the Term Bonds or portions of Term
Bonds to be redeemed shall be
selected by lot prior to the selection
by lot of the Term Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Redemption
Obligations.
Series 1996 Bonds to be redeemed
pursuant to optional redemption
shall be redeemed only upon written notice from the City to the
Trustee, given upon the direction of
the Council by adoption of a resolution or ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Series 1996 Bonds to be
redeemed, and shall be given at
least 45 days prior to the redemption date or such shorter period as
shall be acceptable to the Trustee.
In the event that notice of redemption shall have been given by the
Trustee to the registered owners as
provided in the Indenture, there
shall be deposited with the Trustee,
on or prior to the redemption date,
moneys that, in addition to any
other money available therefor and
held by the Trustee, will be sufficient to redeem at the redemption
price thereof, plus interest accrued
to the redemption date, all of the
redeemable Series 1996 Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given.
Further procedures and conditions
for the satisfaction of the Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements and

system is utilized, (i) the Series
1996 Bonds shall be issued in the
form of a single registered Series
1996 Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of
the Depository or its nominee, as
registered owner, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository;
(ii) the beneficial owners in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Series 1996 Bonds in the
form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Series 1996 Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Director of
Finance and Trustee may attempt to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository.
If the Director of Finance and
Trustee do not or are unable to do
so, the Director of Finance and
Trustee, after making provision for
notification of the beneficial owners
by the then Depository and any
other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the
Series 1996 Bonds from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
registered Series 1996 Bond certificates to the assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost
and expense (including any costs of
printing), if the event is not the
result of City action or inaction, of
those
persons
requesting
such
issuance.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Parks,
Recreation and Properties, or any
one of them are authorized and
directed to the extent necessary or
required to enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book entry system
for the Series 1996 Bonds, after
determining (as evidenced by their
signing) that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securities of the City under the Indenture.
(e) Capital Appreciation Bonds.
Notwithstanding any other provision
of this ordinance to the contrary,
the Director of Finance, if determined to be in the best interest of
and financial advantage to the City,
may designate in the Certificate of
Award certain maturities of the
Series 1996 Bonds as “Capital Appre-

1332

June 26, 1996
ciation Bonds” (CABs). The CABs, if
any, shall be issued in an aggregate
principal amount set forth in the
Certificate of Award, shall bear
interest from their date of delivery
at the rate or rates of interest as
shall be determined in the Certificate of Award to be such as will
result in the aggregate principal
and interest due at the stated maturity of that CAB; provided that the
CABs of any one stated maturity all
shall bear the same compounding
rate of interest. CABs shall be
issued in the denomination equal to
the original principal amount that,
when interest is accrued and compounded thereon on each Interest
Accretion Date, defined below, to
the stated maturity date of the
CABs, will equal a $5,000 maturity
amount (being the principal and
interest due and payable at the stated maturity of that CAB) or any
integral multiple thereof. However,
in no case as to a particular maturity date shall CABs be issued in
denominations exceeding the principal amount maturing on that date.
In the event CABs are issued, the
rate or rates of interest to be borne
by the Series 1996 Bonds, as specified in the Certificate of Award,
shall be such that the Series 1996
Bonds shall have a True Interest
Rate, defined below, not exceeding
9% per year. The debt charges on
CABs shall be payable when due as
set forth in the Indenture.
As used in this subparagraph (e):
“Interest Accretion Dates” means
the semiannual dates as set forth
and so designated in the Certificate
of Award; and “True Interest Rate”
means the rate determined by doubling the semi-annual interest rate,
computed semiannually, necessary
to discount all payments of principal and interest on the Series 1996
Bonds to the purchase price at
which the Series 1996 Bonds are sold
to the Original Purchaser, exclusive
of any accrued interest.
Section 4. Sale of the Series 1996
Bonds; Disclosure Documents. The
Series 1996 Bonds are awarded and
sold to the Original Purchaser in
accordance
with
the
Purchase
Agreement and at the Purchase
Price as shall be determined in the
Certificate of Award.
For the purpose of implementing
the provisions of this ordinance, the
Director of Finance is hereby authorized and directed to sign the Certificate of Award selling the Series
1996 Bonds to the Original Purchaser at the price established therein
and in accordance with this ordinance, and to evidence that sale and
the further terms and provisions
thereof by completing, signing and
delivering the Purchase Agreement
substantially in the form now on
file with the Clerk of Council after
approval thereof by the Director of
Law. The form of Purchase Agreement is hereby approved with such
changes therein as are not inconsistent with this ordinance and not
adverse to the City and as shall be
approved by the officers signing the
Purchase Agreement. The approval
of those changes, and the determination that those changes are not
adverse to the City, shall be conclusively evidenced by that signing.
Having due regard to the best
interests of the City there shall be
further determined in the Certificate
of Award or, as appropriate, in the
Indenture or First Supplemental
Indenture, consistent with the provisions of this ordinance, (a) the
date of the Series 1996 Bonds, (b)

June 26, 1996
the
final
aggregate
principal
amount of the Series 1996 Bonds, (c)
the aggregate principal amount and
principal maturities of the Series
1996 Bonds to be issued as Serial
Bonds or as Term Bonds, the Principal Payment Dates on which those
Series 1996 Bonds shall be stated to
mature and the Principal Payment
Dates for those Series 1996 Bonds
and the principal amount thereof
that shall be stated to mature on
each such Principal Payment Date,
and as to any Term Bonds, the Principal Payment Date(s) on which
Term Bonds shall be subject to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption and the principal amount thereof that shall be payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements on each such Mandatory
Redemption date in accordance with
the provisions of the Indenture, (d)
the dates and prices upon and at
which any Series 1996 Bonds shall
be subject to optional redemption,
(e) the Interest Payment Dates and
the rate or rates of interest to be
borne by the Series 1996 Bonds, (f)
the Purchase Price of the Series
1996 Bonds, and (g) any other matters as provided in this ordinance,
all subject, however, to the following further considerations:
(i) The rate or rates of interest
per year to be borne by the Series
1996 Bonds shall be such as are
determined to be required by marketing considerations and to result
in the sale of the Series 1996 Bonds
on a basis most favorable to the
City; provided, that the Series 1996
Bonds of any one stated maturity
all shall bear the same rate of interest, and that rate may not exceed
9% per year.
(ii) The schedule of the principal
amount of Series 1996 Bonds maturing or payable pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements on
each Principal Payment Date and
the dates and prices upon and at
which any Series 1996 Bonds shall
be subject to optional redemption,
shall be determined to be consistent
with the anticipated Pledged Revenues and to be productive of the
most favorable interest rates on the
Series 1996 Bonds and their maximum receptivity in the market; and
(iii)The rate or rates of interest
per year to be borne by the Series
1996
Bonds,
and
the
principal
amount of Series 1996 Bonds maturing or payable pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements on
each Principal Payment Date, shall
be such that the total principal and
interest payments on the Series 1996
Bonds in any fiscal year in which
principal is payable is not more
than three times the amount of
those payments in any other fiscal
year.
It is hereby determined by this
Council that the terms of the Series
1996 Bonds and the procedures for
their sale and the determination of
the price to be paid for them, all as
established in accordance with the
Bond
Legislation,
the
Purchase

and will be in the best interest of
the City.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Clerk of Council and
other City officials as appropriate
are directed to make the necessary
arrangements on behalf of the City
to establish the date, location, procedure and conditions for the delivery of the Series 1996 Bonds to the

City and in their official capacities,
to (i) prepare or cause to be prepared, and make or authorize modifications, completions or changes of
or supplements to, a disclosure document in the form of a preliminary
official statement relating to the
issuance of the Series 1996 Bonds,
and (ii) determine, and certify or
otherwise represent, when the preliminary official statement as so
prepared is a “deemed final” official
statement

of such a preliminary official statement is hereby authorized and
approved.
Those officers and each of them

behalf of the City and in their official capacities, to complete that preliminary official statement with
such modifications, changes and
supplements as those officers shall
approve or authorize for the purpose
of preparing and determining, and

revised is a final official statement
for purposes of SEC Rule 15c2-12(b)
(3) and (4). Those officers each are
further authorized to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, the final official statement and supplements thereto in
connection
with
the
original
issuance of the Series 1996 Bonds as
may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Those officers
each are further authorized to sign
and deliver, on behalf of the City
and in their official capacities, the
final official statement and such

accuracy of the preliminary official
statement and the final official
statement
and
any

thereto as may, in their judgment,
also be necessary or appropriate.

Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above are authorized

Director of Parks, Recreation and
Properties or any two of them are
authorized and directed, for and in
the name of the City and on its
behalf, to sign and deliver to the
Trustee the Trust Indenture and the
First Supplemental Indenture, substantially in the forms now on file
with the Clerk of Council after

Law. The form of Trust Indenture
and the First Supplemental Indenture are each hereby approved with
such changes therein as are not
inconsistent with the Bond Legislation and not adverse to the City and
which are permitted by the Constitution and laws of Ohio and as shall
be approved by the officers signing
the Trust Indenture and the First
Supplemental
Indenture.
The
approval of those changes, and the
determination that such changes are
not adverse to the City, shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
of the Trust Indenture and the First
Supplemental Indenture, by those
officials.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Parks,
Recreation
and
Properties,
the
Director of Law, the Clerk of Council and such other officers of the
City as may be appropriate are
authorized and directed to furnish,
execute and deliver such documents,
certifications and instruments as
may be necessary or appropriate to
issue the Series 1996 Bonds and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein, and in the Indenture, any Rate Exchange Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Purchase Agreement. The Clerk
of Council or other appropriate official of the City shall furnish the
Original Purchasers a true transcript of proceedings certified by
the Clerk or other official, of all
proceedings had with reference to
the issuance of the Series 1996
Bonds along with such information

Bonds.
Section
12.
Interest
Rate
Exchange Agreement. This Council
finds that by engaging in interest
rate swap transactions, from time to
time, the City can, in effect, convert
interest on all or a portion of the
Series 1996 Bonds from a fixed rate
to a floating rate, or from a floating rate to a fixed rate, and thereby may reduce its cost of borrowing
by optimizing the relative amounts
of fixed and floating rate obligations from time to time and minimizing the risk of variations in its
debt service costs. To permit the

June 26, 1996
City to have the flexibility to undertake such interest rate swap transactions and to establish the procedures for approving such transactions, this Council authorizes the
execution and delivery of an Interest Rate Exchange Agreement (the
“Rate Exchange Agreement”) and
any related agreements necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Rate
Exchange Agreement.
Upon the recommendation of the
financial advisor of the City to the
Director of Finance that an interest
rate swap transaction be undertaken by the City, the Director of
Finance may authorize such an
interest rate swap transaction in
accordance with the Rate Exchange
Agreement; provided that (a) the
maximum
aggregate
notional
amount of interest rate swap transactions outstanding at any one time,
net of offsetting interest rate swap
transactions, shall not exceed an
amount equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all
Series
1996
Bonds
Outstanding
under the Indenture, and (b) the
term of each interest rate swap
transaction shall not exceed 30
years. The aggregate amount of all
such rate interest swap transactions
in effect as of any time shall be
determined on a net basis; that is,
where
any
such
transaction
is
entered into to offset or reverse an
earlier transaction, to the extent of
the offsetting or reversing effect,
the amounts of such offsetting or
reversing interest rate swap transactions shall not be included in the
aggregate total. The approval of
each interest rate swap transaction
by the Director of Finance shall be
conclusively evidenced by the execution of the applicable interest rate
swap transaction by the Director of
Finance or any other person duly
authorized by this Council to execute interest rate swap transactions.
The City may pay any amounts
due
under
the
Rate
Exchange
Agreement and the interest rate
swap transactions from the Pledged
Revenues, and any other available
moneys of the City permitted by law
to be used for the purpose of making those payments.
Anything in this Bond Legislation, the Rate Exchange Agreement
or any interest rate swap transaction to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligation of the City to
make payments under the Rate
Exchange Agreement and any interest rate swap transaction does not
and shall not represent or constitute
a general obligation, debt, bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the
faith and credit of the City, the
State of Ohio or any other political
subdivision thereof. Nothing herein
gives
any
party
to
the
Rate
Exchange Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio or by the taxing authority
of any other political subdivision
for the payment of any amounts due
under the Rate Exchange Agreement and the interest rate swap
transactions.
Section 13. Severability. Each section of this ordinance and each subdivision or paragraph of any section
hereof is declared to be independent
and the finding or holding of any
section or any subdivision or paragraph of any section hereof to be
invalid or void shall not be deemed
or held to affect the validity of any
other section, subdivision or paragraph of this ordinance.

The City Record
Section 14. Validity. This Council
determines that all acts and conditions necessary to be done or performed by the City or to have been
met precedent to and in the issuing
of the Series 1996 Bonds in order to
make them legal, valid and binding
special obligations of the City have
been performed and have been met,
or will at the time of delivery of the
Series 1996 Bonds have been performed and have been met, in regular and due form as required by
law; and that no statutory or constitutional limitation of indebtedness or taxation will have been
exceeded in the issuance of the
Series 1996 Bonds. It is further
found and determined, and is hereby represented and recited, that the
provisions of Sections 28, 29, 32, 33
(including the provisions of Section
33 with respect to readings on three
separate days or dispensing with
such readings by a two-thirds vote
of all members of the Council), 36,
37, 48 and all other applicable provisions of the City’s Charter and the
rules of this Council have been fully
complied with and this ordinance
was passed in conformity therewith.
Section 15. Compliance with Open
Meeting Law. This Council finds
and determines that all formal
actions of this Council concerning
and relating to the passage of this
ordinance were taken in an open
meeting of this Council and that all
deliberations of this Council and of
any committees that resulted in
those formal actions were in meetings open to the public in compliance with the law.
Section 16. Effective Date. This
ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the usual
operation of a municipal department
and providing for the immediate
preservation of the public peace,
property, health or safety in that
the issuance of the Series 1996
Bonds authorized by this ordinance
is needed to enable the City to take
advantage of current favorable market conditions to refund the Refunded Bonds and thereby reduce the
financing costs of the 1992 Project
and,
provided
this
ordinance
receives the affirmative vote of twothirds of all members elected to
Council, it shall take effect and be
in force immediately upon its passage and approval by the Mayor;
otherwise, it shall take effect and
be in force from and after the earliest date allowed by law.
Passed June 18, 1996.
