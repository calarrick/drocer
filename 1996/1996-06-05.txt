By Councilman Coats.
An emergency ordinance to enact
Section 451.34 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
establishing zones for passenger
bus parking; permits and violations.
Whereas, the lack of designated
parking areas for passenger buses
at certain areas and neighborhoods
of the City of Cleveland has occasionally impaired the flow of traffic
and resulted in motor vehicle congestion, particularly at museums
and tourist attractions; and
Whereas, the parking of certain
motor vehicles, i.e. passenger buses
and recreational vehicles at locations not suitable to accommodate
these vehicles threatens the health,
safety, and welfare of many of the
residents of the City; and
Whereas, it is necessary to establish passenger bus parking spaces
and
zones
at
various
locations
throughout the City of Cleveland to
circumvent these concerns; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 451.34 thereof to read
as follows:
Section 451.34 Establishment of
Zones for Passenger Bus Parking;
Permits; Violations
(a) The Director of Public Safety
is authorized to establish zones on
public streets and at public parking
facilities to be reserved for persons
standing
or
parking
passenger
buses. As used in this Section, the
term “passenger bus” shall refer to
every motor vehicle designed for
carrying sixteen or more passengers
and used for the transportation of
persons, other than in a ridesharing
arrangement
as
defined
in
RC
4511.01(DDD), and every school bus
as defined in Section 4511.01(F).
Prior to the establishment of any
such zone, the Commissioner of
Traffic Engineering and Parking
shall conduct a study and report the
findings to the Director of Public
Safety together with recommendations as to the need for and the
advisability of creating the zone.
The investigation shall consider all
relevant traffic engineering considerations, including without limitation the specific considerations identified in this division. Following the
investigation, the zone shall not be
established if the Director of Public
Safety determines that any of the
following are true:
(1) Establishing proposed zone

1033

5
would create or contribute to a traffic flow or traffic congestion problem.
(2) The proposed zone is in an
area already experiencing traffic
congestion, and there are adequate
off-street areas for standing or
parking passenger buses, and the
proposed zone cannot be implemented without resolving, accommodating, or decreasing said traffic
congestion.
(3) The proposed zone is presently a restricted parking area, unless
the investigation of the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering and
Parking reveals that it is desirable
to lift or change the restriction.
(b) The establishment of a zone
pursuant to this Section shall be
effective ten (10) days after publication of a notice in the City Record
and upon the posting of signs sufficient in number and location to
apprise the ordinarily observant person of the existence of the zone, and
shall have the force and effect of
law until rescinded by the Director
of Public Safety or until disapproved by ordinance of Council.
(c) The use of any zone established pursuant to this Section shall
be suspended on any street of the
City which has been closed pursuant
to any lawful authority, including
without limitation street closings
made pursuant to Sections 133.09,
403.05 or 411.05 of these Codified
Ordinances.
(d) Parking Permit Requirement;
Permit Application; Fee; Issuance.
(1) Prior to parking a passenger
bus in a parking space designated
for passenger bus parking, the
owner of such passenger bus shall
obtain a passenger bus parking permit, by filing a permit application
with the Director of Public Safety
containing the following information:
A. The name, address, and telephone number of the owner;
B. The name, address, and telephone number of the individual or
other person to whom the City shall
serve in person or by mail any
notice or order required by this Section.
C. A certified copy of the vehicle
title and registration must accompany the permit application.
(2) A separate application must
be filed for each passenger bus for
which a parking permit is being
sought.
(3) A fifty dollar ($50.00) fee
must accompany each permit application to defray the expenses incident to the administration of the
provisions of this Section. This permit application fee shall be waived
for school buses and other passenger buses owned by governmental
agencies.
(4) Permits shall be issued by the
Director of Public Safety in accordance with division (d)(6) of this
Section. Permits so issued shall be
valid for a period of one year, or
any portion thereof. Permits shall
expire on the thirty-first day of
March of each year.
(5)
Every
owner
desiring
to
renew a passenger bus parking
permit shall file a new permit application with the Director of Public
Safety containing the information
required by division (d)(1) of this
Section.
(6) Upon receipt of the information required by division (d)(1) of
this Section and payment of the
required fees to the Director, a permit shall be issued.
All
permits
shall
be
issued,

6
renewed, or denied with fifteen (15)
working days of the filing of the
permit application. Notice of a permit denial shall be served in person
or by certified mail to the individual or other person identified in the
permit application as required by
division (d)(1)B. of this Section.
Any permit issued pursuant to this
Section shall not be assigned or
transferred to any other owner of a
passenger bus.
(7) Permit shall be displayed in a
manner determined by the Chief of
Police.
(e) No person shall stand or park
a vehicle in a zone established for
passenger bus parking, and no person shall stand or park a passenger
bus in a zone established for passenger bus parking unless a permit
has been previously issued therefore
in accordance with the requirements
of this Section, and unless the permit sticker is displayed in a manner determined by the Chief of
Police.
(f) The Director of Public Safety
shall have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this Section.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

Whereas, this Council finds and
determines that the debt service

interest of the City to advance

the issuance of the Series 1996
Bonds, thereby reducing the financing costs of the 1992 Project;
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation

of the Series 1996 Bonds authorized
by this ordinance is needed to
enable the City to take advantage

and thereby reduce the financing
costs of the 1992 Project; now, therefore,

Section
2.
Determinations
by
Council. This Council finds and
determines as follows:
(a) Public Purpose. The Council
of the City found and determined at
the time of the issuance of the
Series 1992 Bonds, and hereby reaffirms, that: it was necessary for the
City to acquire, construct, improve,
rehabilitate and equip the municipal
parking facilities comprising the
1992 Project; the 1992 Project and
the issuance of the Series 1992
Bonds to pay costs of the 1992 Project, and the issuance of the Series
1996 Bonds to advance refund the
Series 1992 Bonds, served and serves
a proper public municipal purpose
by providing needed parking facilities to the people of the City, alleviating traffic congestion on the
streets of the City, thereby facilitating the movement of traffic, the
movement of police and fire vehicles in the City for the safety and
welfare of its citizens, and the
cleaning of the streets for the
health, safety and welfare of its citizens. The facilities comprising the
1992 Project are located in designated urban renewal areas of the
City, and the City’s completion of
the municipal facilities constituting
the 1992 Project in those urban
renewal areas, and the issuance of
the Series 1992 Bonds to pay costs
of the 1992 Project and the issuance
of the Series 1996 Bonds to advance
refund the Series 1992 Bonds, were
and will be undertaken for the elimination of conditions of blight determined to exist in those areas and to
prevent the reoccurrence of such
conditions of blight. The 1992 Project advances the economic welfare
of the City by increasing and promoting
commerce
by
providing
parking facilities for surrounding
businesses and other commercial
enterprises, and the 1992 Project creates and preserves jobs and employment opportunities in the City and
improves the economic welfare of
the City by maintaining and improving access to the City by the commuting public.
(b) Issuance of Series 1996 Bonds.
It is necessary and proper, expedient and in the best interest of the
City to, and the City shall, issue the
Series 1996 Bonds for the purpose of
providing funds to advance refund
the Refunded Bonds. The aggregate
principal amount of Series 1996
Bonds to be issued shall not exceed
$85,000,000, assuming that the Series
1996 Bonds are to be initially

12
offered to the public at a price at
least equal to one hundred percent
(100%) of their aggregate principal
amount, but, if any of the Series
1996 Bonds are to be initially
offered to the public at an original
issue discount, then the maximum
aggregate principal amount of the
Series 1996 Bonds hereby authorized, shall be increased over those
amounts by an amount equal to the
sum of the products obtained by
multiplying the original issue discount at which each Series 1996
Bond is to be initially offered to the
public, by the principal amount of
the Series 1996 Bond to be so
offered. Subject to the immediately
preceding sentence, the aggregate
principal amount of the Series 1996
Bonds shall be in an amount determined in the Certificate of Award to
be the aggregate principal amount
of Series 1996 Bonds that are
required to be issued, taking into
account any other funds available to
the City for the purpose, including
any moneys in the 1992 Funds that
are to be made available for the
advance refunding of the Refunded
Bonds in accordance with Section 9
of
this
ordinance,
in
order
to
advance
refund
the
Refunded
Bonds, to establish any reserves
required under the Indenture, to pay
expenses relating to that advance
refunding or the issuance of the
Series 1996 Bonds and otherwise to
effect the purpose for which the
Series 1996 Bonds are to be issued.
(c) Pledged Revenues. Bond Service Charges on the Series 1996
Bonds and any additional Bonds
issued under the Indenture shall be
payable from the Pledged Revenues
as defined and described in the
Indenture. The Pledged Revenues
generally shall include the fees,
charges and other income derived
from the City’s operation or ownership of certain off-street parking
facilities, after provision for the reasonable operating and maintenance
expense thereof, all proceeds from
the lease, management, sale or other
disposition of those off-street parking facilities, the income from the
City’s ownership or operation of onstreet parking facilities, and the
amounts in the Funds as provided
in the Indenture. The Pledged Revenues may include, as additional
security for the Bonds, to the extent
provided for and subject to the
terms and conditions of the Indenture, any of the following moneys
not raised by taxation: all receipts
of
the
City
relating
to
fines,
waivers,
court
costs
and
other
receipts relating to the violation of
municipal parking ordinances, all
fines, waivers and court costs collected by the City for any misdemeanor offense under municipal
ordinances, and any urban renewal
service payments collected from any
part of one or more urban renewal
areas in the City available for the
purpose
and
designated
in
the
Indenture.
(d) Refunding of Series 1992
Bonds. It is necessary and in the
best interest of the City to advance
refund the Refunded Bonds and to
redeem by optional redemption on
September 15, 2002 the Refunded
Bonds maturing after that date. The
Director of Finance is authorized
and directed to give written notice
to the 1992 Trustee of that call for
redemption,
and
the
Refunded
Bonds maturing after September 15,
2002 shall be redeemed in accor-

Series
1996
Bonds shall be issued only in registered form, substantially in that
form set forth in Exhibit A to the
Indenture. The Series 1996 Bonds
shall contain on the face thereof a
statement to the effect that the
Series 1996 Bonds, as to both principal and interest, are not a general obligation of the City but are
payable solely from the Pledged
Revenues.
The terms, provisions,
denominations and principal maturities
of,
redemption
provisions
applicable to, and the interest rates
to be borne by, the Series 1996
Bonds shall be those set forth in the
Certificate of Award executed pursuant to Section 4 of this ordinance
and in the Trust Indenture and
First Supplemental Indenture executed pursuant to Section 11 of this
ordinance.
The Series 1996 Bonds shall be
dated as of July 1, 1996, or such
later date, not more than 50 days
prior to the date of their initial
delivery, as may be established in
the Certificate of Award; shall bear

recent date to which interest has
been paid or duly provided for, and
that interest shall be payable, as
provided for in the Indenture; shall

Award and the Indenture; and shall

City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Series 1996 Bonds
and
shall
endorse
thereon
her
approval of the form and correctness by her manual or facsimile signature.
The Series 1996 Bonds shall, if not
in book entry form, be exchangeable
for Series 1996 Bonds of Authorized
Denominations, as provided in the
Indenture, and shall be issued in
Authorized Denominations. Series
1996 Bonds shall be numbered in
such manner as determined by the
Trustee in order to distinguish each
Series 1996 Bond from any other
Series 1996 Bond, shall be subject to
optional redemption in the amounts,
upon the conditions, and at the
times and prices, and may be subject to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption in the amounts and at
the times and prices, all as set forth
in or provided for by or pursuant to
the Bond Legislation and upon the
conditions set forth in the Indenture. Bond Service Charges on the
Series 1996 Bonds shall be payable
as provided in the Indenture, in
each instance without deduction for
the services of any paying agent.
(b) Principal Maturities, Interest
Rates and Mandatory and Optional
Redemption. The Series 1996 Bonds
shall mature on the Principal Payment Dates and be payable in the
principal amounts or in accordance
with
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Requirements, and shall bear interest at the rates per annum, payable
on each Interest Payment Date, all
as to be set forth in the Certificate
of Award.
The Series 1996 Bonds may be
subject to redemption prior to stated maturity as follows:

1040

June 5, 1996
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If requested by the Original
Purchaser and confirmed in the Certificate of Award, any annual principal maturity amount may be consolidated with one or more consecutive
preceding
annual
principal
maturity amounts into a single
aggregate principal amount maturing on that stated annual maturity
date. In that case, those Term Bonds
then maturing on that stated annual maturity date shall be subject to
Mandatory Redemption prior to stated maturity in part pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements, at a redemption price of
100%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed plus interest accrued to
the redemption date. Portions of the
Term Bonds shall be so redeemed on
the Principal Payment Date in each
of those preceding years and in the
respective
full
annual
principal
amounts listed in a principal maturity schedule set forth in the Certificate of Award for payment in
those preceding years (the Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements).
If retired only by Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption prior to their
stated maturity, the remaining principal amount of any Term Bonds
will be paid at their stated maturity date. The aggregate of the
money to be deposited with the
Trustee in the Bond Service Fund
for
payment
of
Bond
Service
Charges
on
Term
Bonds
shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem the principal amount of
Term Bonds set forth opposite the
respective dates in the principal
maturity schedule set forth in the
Certificate
of
Award
(less
the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Trustee for cancellation Term Bonds in any aggregate
principal amount and to receive a
credit against any then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirement (and corresponding Mandatory
Redemption Obligation) as set forth
pursuant to the above for any Term
Bonds. That option shall be exercised by the City on or before the
45th day preceding the applicable
Mandatory Redemption date, by furnishing the Trustee a certificate,
signed by the Director of Finance,
setting forth the extent of the credit to be applied with respect to the
then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Requirement. If a certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Trustee,
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Requirement (and corresponding Mandatory Redemption Obligation) shall not be reduced. A credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Requirement (and
corresponding Mandatory Redemption
Obligation)
also
shall
be
received by the City for any Term
Bonds which prior thereto have
been redeemed (other than through
the operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and cancelled by the Trustee, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any Mandatory Redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and cancelled, shall be credited by
the Trustee at 100% of its principal
amount against the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirement (and corresponding Mandatory
Redemption Obligation). Any excess
of that amount over the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund

June 5, 1996
Requirement
shall
be
credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements (and corresponding
Mandatory
Redemption
Obligations) in the order directed
by the Director of Finance.
Optional Redemption. If determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award to be necessary or advisable to the sale of
the Series 1996 Bonds, the Series
1996 Bonds shall, as provided in the
Certificate of Award, be subject to
redemption by and at the option of
the City, in whole on any date or in
part on any Interest Payment Date,
in integral multiples of $5,000, at
the
redemption
prices
specified
(expressed as a percentage of the
principal amount redeemed), plus in
each case accrued interest to the
redemption date; provided that the
earliest optional redemption date
shall not be earlier than September
15, 2004, and the highest redemption
price shall not be greater than
102%.
If optional redemption of any
Term Bonds at a redemption price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption date provided for
pursuant to the above provisions,
the Term Bonds or portions of Term
Bonds to be redeemed shall be
selected by lot prior to the selection
by lot of the Term Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Redemption
Obligations.
Series 1996 Bonds to be redeemed
pursuant to optional redemption
shall be redeemed only upon written notice from the City to the
Trustee, given upon the direction of
the Council by adoption of a resolution or ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Series 1996 Bonds to be
redeemed, and shall be given at
least 45 days prior to the redemption date or such shorter period as
shall be acceptable to the Trustee.
In the event that notice of redemption shall have been given by the
Trustee to the registered owners as
provided in the Indenture, there
shall be deposited with the Trustee,
on or prior to the redemption date,
moneys that, in addition to any
other money available therefor and
held by the Trustee, will be sufficient to redeem at the redemption
price thereof, plus interest accrued
to the redemption date, all of the
redeemable Series 1996 Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given.
Further procedures and conditions
for the satisfaction of the Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements and
optional redemption or Mandatory
Redemption are set forth in the
Indenture.
(c) Authorization of Bond Rating
and Bond Insurance. If in the judgment of the Director of Finance the
filing of applications for a rating on
the Series 1996 Bonds by one or
more Rating Services, or for a policy of Bond Insurance or other Credit Support Instrument relating to
the Series 1996 Bonds, are necessary
or desirable for marketing purposes,
the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare and submit either
or both of those applications, to provide such information as may be
required in support of them and to
provide further for the payment of
the cost of such a rating or policy
(or other Credit Support Instrument) payable by the City from pro-

The City Record
ceeds of the Series 1996 Bonds to the
extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
(d) Book Entry Form. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this ordinance, the
Series 1996
Bonds shall be issued to a Depository for use in a book entry system
and, if and as long as a book entry
system is utilized, (i) the Series
1996 Bonds shall be issued in the
form of a single registered Series
1996 Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of
the Depository or its nominee, as
registered owner, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository;
(ii) the beneficial owners in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Series 1996 Bonds in the
form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Series 1996 Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Director of
Finance and Trustee may attempt to
establish
a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship
with
another qualified Depository. If the
Director of Finance and Trustee do
not or are unable to do so, the Director of Finance and Trustee, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the Series 1996
Bonds from the Depository, and
authenticate and deliver registered
Series 1996 Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Parks,
Recreation and Properties, or any
one of them are authorized and
directed to the extent necessary or
required to enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book entry system
for the Series 1996 Bonds, after
determining (as evidenced by their
signing) that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securities of the City under the Indenture.
(e) Capital Appreciation Bonds.
Notwithstanding any other provision
of this ordinance to the contrary,
the Director of Finance, if determined to be in the best interest of
and financial advantage to the City,
may designate in the Certificate of
Award certain maturities of the
Series 1996 Bonds as “Capital Appreciation Bonds” (CABs). The CABs, if
any, shall be issued in an aggregate
principal amount set forth in the
Certificate of Award, shall bear
interest from their date of delivery
at the rate or rates of interest as
shall be determined in the Certificate of Award to be such as will
result in the aggregate principal

1041

13
and interest due at the stated maturity of that CAB; provided that the
CABs of any one stated maturity all
shall bear the same compounding
rate of interest. CABs shall be
issued in the denomination equal to
the original principal amount that,
when interest is accrued and compounded thereon on each Interest
Accretion Date, defined below, to
the stated maturity date of the
CABs, will equal a $5,000 maturity
amount (being the principal and
interest due and payable at the stated maturity of that CAB) or any
integral multiple thereof. However,
in no case as to a particular maturity date shall CABs be issued in
denominations exceeding the principal amount maturing on that date.
In the event CABs are issued, the
rate or rates of interest to be borne
by the Series 1996 Bonds, as specified in the Certificate of Award,
shall be such that the Series 1996
Bonds shall have a True Interest
Rate, defined below, not exceeding
9% per year. The debt charges on
CABs shall be payable when due as
set forth in the Indenture.
As used in this subparagraph (e):
“Interest Accretion Dates” means
the semiannual dates as set forth
and so designated in the Certificate
of Award; and “True Interest Rate”
means the rate determined by doubling the semi-annual interest rate,
computed semiannually, necessary
to discount all payments of principal and interest on the Series 1996
Bonds to the purchase price at
which the Series 1996 Bonds are sold
to the Original Purchaser, exclusive
of any accrued interest.
Section 4. Sale of the Series 1996
Bonds; Disclosure Documents. The
Series 1996 Bonds are awarded and
sold to the Original Purchaser in
accordance
with
the
Purchase
Agreement and at the Purchase
Price as shall be determined in the
Certificate of Award.
For the purpose of implementing
the provisions of this ordinance, the
Director of Finance is hereby authorized and directed to sign the Certificate of Award selling the Series
1996 Bonds to the Original Purchaser at the price established therein
and in accordance with this ordinance, and to evidence that sale and
the further terms and provisions
thereof by completing, signing and
delivering the Purchase Agreement
substantially in the form now on
file with the Clerk of Council after
approval thereof by the Director of
Law. The form of Purchase Agreement is hereby approved with such
changes therein as are not inconsistent with this ordinance and not
adverse to the City and as shall be
approved by the officers signing the
Purchase Agreement. The approval
of those changes, and the determination that those changes are not
adverse to the City, shall be conclusively evidenced by that signing.
Having due regard to the best
interests of the City there shall be
further determined in the Certificate
of Award or, as appropriate, in the
Indenture or First Supplemental
Indenture, consistent with the provisions of this ordinance, (a) the
date of the Series 1996 Bonds, (b)
the
final
aggregate
principal
amount of the Series 1996 Bonds, (c)
the aggregate principal amount and
principal maturities of the Series
1996 Bonds to be issued as Serial
Bonds or as Term Bonds, the Principal Payment Dates on which those
Series 1996 Bonds shall be stated to

14
mature and the Principal Payment
Dates for those Series 1996 Bonds
and the principal amount thereof
that shall be stated to mature on
each such Principal Payment Date,
and as to any Term Bonds, the Principal Payment Date(s) on which
Term Bonds shall be subject to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption and the principal amount thereof that shall be payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements on each such Mandatory
Redemption date in accordance with
the provisions of the Indenture, (d)
the dates and prices upon and at
which any Series 1996 Bonds shall
be subject to optional redemption,
(e) the Interest Payment Dates and
the rate or rates of interest to be
borne by the Series 1996 Bonds, (f)
the Purchase Price of the Series
1996 Bonds, and (g) any other matters as provided in this ordinance,
all subject, however, to the following further considerations:
(i) The rate or rates of interest
per year to be borne by the Series
1996 Bonds shall be such as are
determined to be required by marketing considerations and to result
in the sale of the Series 1996 Bonds
on a basis most favorable to the
City; provided, that the Series 1996
Bonds of any one stated maturity
all shall bear the same rate of interest, and that rate may not exceed
9% per year.
(ii) The schedule of the principal
amount of Series 1996 Bonds maturing or payable pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements on
each Principal Payment Date and
the dates and prices upon and at
which any Series 1996 Bonds shall
be subject to optional redemption,
shall be determined to be consistent
with the anticipated Pledged Revenues and to be productive of the
most favorable interest rates on the
Series 1996 Bonds and their maximum receptivity in the market; and
(iii)The rate or rates of interest
per year to be borne by the Series
1996
Bonds,
and
the
principal
amount of Series 1996 Bonds maturing or payable pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund Requirements on
each Principal Payment Date, shall
be such that the total principal and
interest payments on the Series 1996
Bonds in any fiscal year in which
principal is payable is not more
than three times the amount of
those payments in any other fiscal
year.
It is hereby determined by this
Council that the terms of the Series
1996 Bonds and the procedures for
their sale and the determination of
the price to be paid for them, all as
established in accordance with the
Bond
Legislation,
the
Purchase
Agreement and the Indenture, are
and will be in the best interest of
the City.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Clerk of Council and
other City officials as appropriate
are directed to make the necessary
arrangements on behalf of the City
to establish the date, location, procedure and conditions for the delivery of the Series 1996 Bonds to the
Original Purchaser and to take all
actions necessary to effect due signing, authentication and delivery of
the Series 1996 Bonds under the
terms of the Bond Legislation, the
Purchase Agreement and the Indenture.

of it for the interest on the Series
1996 Bonds to be and to remain

any actions that would adversely

relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Series 1996 Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Series 1996
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Series 1996 Bonds (and,

the Director of Finance and the

authorized and directed, for and in
the name of the City and on its
behalf, to sign and deliver to the
Trustee the Trust Indenture and the

such changes therein as are not
inconsistent with the Bond Legislation and not adverse to the City and
which are permitted by the Constitution and laws of Ohio and as shall
be approved by the officers signing
the Trust Indenture and the First
Supplemental
Indenture.
The
approval of those changes, and the
determination that such changes are
not adverse to the City, shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
of the Trust Indenture and the First
Supplemental Indenture, by those
officials.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Parks,
Recreation
and
Properties,
the
Director of Law, the Clerk of Council and such other officers of the
City as may be appropriate are
authorized and directed to furnish,
execute and deliver such documents,
certifications and instruments as
may be necessary or appropriate to
issue the Series 1996 Bonds and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein, and in the Indenture, any Rate Exchange Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Purchase Agreement. The Clerk
of Council or other appropriate official of the City shall furnish the
Original Purchasers a true transcript of proceedings certified by
the Clerk or other official, of all
proceedings had with reference to
the issuance of the Series 1996
Bonds along with such information

Section
12.
Interest
Rate
Exchange Agreement. This Council
finds that by engaging in interest
rate swap transactions, from time to
time, the City can, in effect, convert
interest on all or a portion of the
Series 1996 Bonds from a fixed rate
to a floating rate, or from a floating rate to a fixed rate, and thereby may reduce its cost of borrowing
by optimizing the relative amounts
of fixed and floating rate obligations from time to time and minimizing the risk of variations in its
debt service costs. To permit the
City to have the flexibility to undertake such interest rate swap transactions and to establish the procedures for approving such transactions, this Council authorizes the
execution and delivery of an Interest Rate Exchange Agreement (the
“Rate Exchange Agreement”) and

16
any related agreements necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Rate
Exchange Agreement.
Upon the recommendation of the
financial advisor of the City to the
Director of Finance that an interest
rate swap transaction be undertaken by the City, the Director of
Finance may authorize such an
interest rate swap transaction in
accordance with the Rate Exchange
Agreement; provided that (a) the
maximum
aggregate
notional
amount of interest rate swap transactions outstanding at any one time,
net of offsetting interest rate swap
transactions, shall not exceed an
amount equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all
Series
1996
Bonds
Outstanding
under the Indenture, and (b) the
term of each interest rate swap
transaction shall not exceed 30
years. The aggregate amount of all
such rate interest swap transactions
in effect as of any time shall be
determined on a net basis; that is,
where
any
such
transaction
is
entered into to offset or reverse an
earlier transaction, to the extent of
the offsetting or reversing effect,
the amounts of such offsetting or
reversing interest rate swap transactions shall not be included in the
aggregate total. The approval of
each interest rate swap transaction
by the Director of Finance shall be
conclusively evidenced by the execution of the applicable interest rate
swap transaction by the Director of
Finance or any other person duly
authorized by this Council to execute interest rate swap transactions.
The City may pay any amounts
due
under
the
Rate
Exchange
Agreement and the interest rate
swap transactions from the Pledged
Revenues, and any other available
moneys of the City permitted by law
to be used for the purpose of making those payments.
Anything in this Bond Legislation, the Rate Exchange Agreement
or any interest rate swap transaction to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligation of the City to
make payments under the Rate
Exchange Agreement and any interest rate swap transaction does not
and shall not represent or constitute
a general obligation, debt, bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the
faith and credit of the City, the
State of Ohio or any other political
subdivision thereof. Nothing herein
gives
any
party
to
the
Rate
Exchange Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio or by the taxing authority
of any other political subdivision
for the payment of any amounts due
under the Rate Exchange Agreement and the interest rate swap
transactions.
Section 13. Severability. Each section of this ordinance and each subdivision or paragraph of any section
hereof is declared to be independent
and the finding or holding of any
section or any subdivision or paragraph of any section hereof to be
invalid or void shall not be deemed
or held to affect the validity of any
other section, subdivision or paragraph of this ordinance.
Section 14. Validity. This Council
determines that all acts and conditions necessary to be done or performed by the City or to have been
met precedent to and in the issuing
of the Series 1996 Bonds in order to
make them legal, valid and binding
special obligations of the City have

The City Record
been performed and have been met,
or will at the time of delivery of the
Series 1996 Bonds have been performed and have been met, in regular and due form as required by
law; and that no statutory or constitutional limitation of indebtedness or taxation will have been
exceeded in the issuance of the
Series 1996 Bonds. It is further
found and determined, and is hereby represented and recited, that the
provisions of Sections 28, 29, 32, 33
(including the provisions of Section
33 with respect to readings on three
separate days or dispensing with
such readings by a two-thirds vote
of all members of the Council), 36,
37, 48 and all other applicable provisions of the City’s Charter and the
rules of this Council have been fully
complied with and this ordinance
was passed in conformity therewith.
Section 15. Compliance with Open
Meeting Law. This Council finds
and determines that all formal
actions of this Council concerning
and relating to the passage of this
ordinance were taken in an open
meeting of this Council and that all
deliberations of this Council and of
any committees that resulted in
those formal actions were in meetings open to the public in compliance with the law.
Section 16. Effective Date. This
ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the usual
operation of a municipal department
and providing for the immediate
preservation of the public peace,
property, health or safety in that
the issuance of the Series 1996
Bonds authorized by this ordinance
is needed to enable the City to take
advantage of current favorable market conditions to refund the Refunded Bonds and thereby reduce the
financing costs of the 1992 Project
and,
provided
this
ordinance
receives the affirmative vote of twothirds of all members elected to
Council, it shall take effect and be
in force immediately upon its passage and approval by the Mayor;
otherwise, it shall take effect and
be in force from and after the earliest date allowed by law.

RENT ADJUSTMENT
Any rental rate stated in Schedules I - IV above may be adjusted
by the Director of Parks, Recreation
and Properties, (“The Director”,)
based upon the determination of the
Commissioner for a particular event
upon compliance with all of the following requirements:
(a) Adjustment Limits. No rental
rate may be increased or decreased
by a percentage greater than sixty
percent (60%) of the rental rate
stated in the applicable Schedule.
(b) Standards for Rent Increases
or Decreases. In adopting this Rent
Schedule Resolution, the Board of
Control understands that a proposed
Convention Center event will provide direct and indirect benefits to
the City of Cleveland in addition to
the rent collected for use of the
facility. These benefits include revenues from food and beverage concessions, revenues from the transient occupancy tax assessed pursuant to Chapter 193 of the C.O., revenues from novelty sales, and revenues from event services provided

1075

47
by City of Cleveland staff and outside contractors (collectively, “Additional Benefits”). The rates set forth
in Schedule I - IV above assume the
event will generate an average
level of Additional Benefits. However, if the Commissioner determines, and the Director concurs,
that an event will generate Additional Benefits substantially less
than or substantially greater than
the Additional Benefits generated
by an average Convention Center
event, the Director may adjust the
event rental rate accordingly. For
example, if by reducing the rental
rate the Director is able to attract
an event which would yield substantial Additional Benefits, the
Director may reduce the rental rate
within the range set forth in paragraph (a) above. By contrast, if a
proposed event will yield minimal
Additional Benefits, the Director
may increase the rental rate within
range set forth in paragraph (a)
above.
(c) Required Approvals for Rent
Increases or Decreases. Rent adjustments shall require the additional
approval of the Director of Law or
his/her designee. These additional
approvals may be evidenced by
these
parties'
execution
and/or
approval of the event contract, as
applicable, provided that a brief justification for the adjustments is set
forth in an “Additional Provisions”
section completed by the Commissioner at the end of the contract
immediately above these parties’
signature lines.
(d) Rent Adjustment Recordkeeping. The Commissioner shall keep
detailed records of all rent adjustments. The Commissioner shall submit to the Office of the Mayor, the
Director of Parks, Recreation and
Properties, and the Director of Law,
a written report summarizing all
rent adjustments made during that
calendar year, on or before January
15 of the following year.
Be it further resolved that Resolution No. 92-94, adopted by the
Board of Control on February 23,
1994, is hereby rescinded as of the
effective date of the rental rates set
forth herein.
Be it further resolved that not
withstanding any provisions of this
or any prior Board of Control resolution, the rental rates, terms and
conditions set forth in this resolution shall apply only to concession
agreements executed and event rate
quotations made in writing on or
after the adoption date of this resolution, without regard to the effective date of rental rates, terms and
conditions herein.
