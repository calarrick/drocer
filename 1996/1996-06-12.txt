new
Section

dangerous to the citizens and particularly children; and
Whereas, the problem of broken
glass caused by improper disposal
of empty beer bottles poses a serious health and safety problem to
the citizens and children of this

Whereas, the problem of broken
glass is exacerbated by individuals
who fail to dispose of such containers properly, thereby littering
the streets, sidewalks, parks, and
other public placed in the City causing a public health nuisance; and
Whereas, enforcement of proper
disposal of glass containers can
help reduce the littering problem
that is occurring on the streets,
sidewalks, parks, and other public
grounds of the City; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of

Ohio, 1976, by enacting new Section

14
629.09 thereof, relating to the retail
sale for off premises consumption of
beer, malt liquor or any malt beverage in chilled glass bottles.
Whereas, the retail sale of certain
alcoholic beverages in breakable
glass containers which are improperly disposed of when empty has
resulted in such a proliferation of
broken glass in and upon the
streets, parks and other public
grounds of the City as to render
said public grounds dangerous to
our citizens and particularly to our
children; and
Whereas, the problem of broken
glass caused by improper disposal
of empty beer bottles poses a serious health and safety problem; and
Whereas, it is virtually impossible
to recycle glass once it is broken
and it is virtually impossible to
remove
all
broken
glass
from
grassy areas in parks and recreational areas; and
Whereas, a substantial cause of
the problem of broken glass littering streets, sidewalks, parks and
other public areas of the City is the
improper disposal of empty bottles
of beer, malt liquor and malt beverages which are sold chilled at
retail for off-premises consumption;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are

(d) This section shall not apply
to any liquor permit holder located
within 1000 feet of another liquor
permit holder selling beer, malt

off-premise consumption in a bordering municipality or township,
provided that the bordering municipality or township has not enacted
an ordinance containing a prohibition similar to the prohibition of
either division (b) or (c) of this section.
(e) Whoever violates this section
shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor. In addition to any other
method of enforcement provided for

minor
