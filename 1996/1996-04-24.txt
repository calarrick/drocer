of Assessments and Licenses.

766

The times and hours for the specific zones are as follows:
Zone 1 - Event days only. Limited to three (3) hours

Only 18 peddlers will be

an entire permit year.
At the discretion of the
Director,
the
permit
year may be divided
into distinct periods of
time, and a selection of

permit by the Director of Public Service and revocation of peddlers
license by the Commissioner of
Assessments and Licenses.
D. PENALTY
1. A peddler who has received a
permit to peddle on public property shall obey any lawful
order of a police officer to
remove
himself/herself
and
his/her vending device entirely
from the sidewalk to avoid congestion or obstruction as a

in whole or in part. Each day
upon which a violation occurs

a separate offense and shall
be punishable as such hereunder.
3. In
addition
to
any
other
method of enforcement provided for in this chapter, the provisions of this section (number
2, above) may be enforced by
