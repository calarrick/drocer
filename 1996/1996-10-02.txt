Res. No. 1807-96.
By Councilman Jackson.
An emergency resolution urging
HUD to provide CMHA with the necessary funding to provide traditional public housing replacement housing, or funding to renovate all buildings at Carver Park Estates, or failing the above, to rescind HOPE VI
Plus

Park
Estates.
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
passed Resolution No. 1488-96, on
August 14, 1996, opposing President
Clinton’s and HUD’s policies that
are detrimental to public housing,
subsidized housing, and low income
people; and
Whereas, demolition of public
housing without traditional replacement housing is a policy that is
detrimental to public housing, subsidized housing and low income people; and
Whereas, HOPE VI Plus has as a
major component the demolishing of
public housing; and
Whereas, Public Housing Authorities applying for HOPE VI Plus
funding receive better consideration
if demolition is part of their application; and
Whereas, it is almost impossible
to receive HOPE VI Plus funding
without including demolition in the
application; and
Whereas, Carver Park Estates has
been awarded funding under HOPE
VI Plus; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority (“CMHA”)
plans to demolish a substantial
number of public housing units at
Carver Park Estates; and
Whereas, CMHA has 10,000 families on their waiting list; and
Whereas, the Department of Housing
and
Urban
Development
(“HUD”) has eliminated the one-forone replacement requirement; and
Whereas, HUD has not provided
CMHA with funding to provide traditional public housing replacement
housing while CMHA has 10,000
families on their waiting list; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that HUD has
failed to provide funding for traditional public housing replacement
housing
while
encouraging
the
demolition of public housing units
at the same time there are 10,000
families on CMHA’s waiting list;
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That HUD provide
CMHA with the necessary funding
to provide traditional public housing replacement housing.

of this resolution, then HUD must
provide CMHA with the necessary

then HUD moves to rescind HOPE
VI Plus funding for Carver Park
Estates.
