Inc., dba Buckeye Discount Grocery,

44104; and
Whereas, the granting of this

12
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor

Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
safety and welfare pursuant to Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said permit must be received by the Director of Liquor Control within 30 days
of notification; now, therefore,

By Councilman Johnson.
An emergency resolution supporting House Bill 385 to raise the age
limit for consentual sexual relations
from 13 years to 17 years, and urging the House to amend the law to
include mandatory life in prison

The City Record
sentencing with no possibility for
parole for anyone convicted of raping a child under 17 years of age.
Whereas, under current law, in
place since the mid-1970s, “statutory
rape” can be charged only if one
participant is under age 13; and
Whereas, under current law, the
offense for engaging in consentual
sexual
relations
with
a
child
between 13 years of age and 17 is
“corruption of a minor”; and
Whereas, incidences of teenage
pregnancies have skyrocketed since
the mid-1970s when the age limit for
sexual consent was set at 13; and
Whereas, a high percentage of the
babies born to teenagers today are
being fathered by men over 21 years
of age; and
Whereas, the House recently took
issue with teenage pregnancies by
amending House Bill 385 to raise
the age of sexual consent from 13
to age 17; and
Whereas,
Ohio
taxpayers
are
forced to bear some of the costs of
the $2.4 billion in Ohio child-support
arrearages; and
Whereas, under current law rape
is an aggravated felony of the first
degree, punishable by up to 25 years
in prison and a fine of up to $10,000;
and
Whereas, if an underage victim is
compelled by force or the threat of
force, the penalty is life in prison;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health, safety or welfare of Ohio’s
youth; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the amendment to House Bill
385 to raise the age limit for consentual sexual relations from 13
years to 17 years.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the House to amend House Bill 385
to include mandatory life in prison
sentencing with no possibility for
parole for anyone convicted of raping a child under 17 years of age if
the underage victim is compelled by
force or the threat of force.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
