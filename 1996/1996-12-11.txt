Rokakis, Miller and Johnson.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor George Voinovich and the
Ohio General Assembly to support a
$4,000,000
increase
in
the
Ohio
Department of Health’s 1998-1999
HIV Drug Assistance budget for
protease inhibitors.
Whereas, there are 1,400 citizens
of Cleveland’s neighborhoods currently living with AIDS; and
Whereas, AIDS is the number one
cause of death in Cuyahoga County
in people between 25 and 44; and
Whereas, AIDS has stricken men,
women and children of all races, all
economic levels, all religions, in
cities and rural areas all over Ohio;
and
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Health’s AIDS Drug Advisory Committee, composed of physicians and
health care professionals, view the
inclusion of protease inhibitors in
the overall AIDS program as an
absolute necessity; and
Whereas, these protease inhibitors
have all been approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
and are widely praised by physicians and scientists at the International AIDS Conference; and

does not include protease inhibitors
and the only state among those with
the highest number of AIDS cases,

Whereas, Ohio’s failure to include
the protease inhibitors in its program may cause Ohio to forfeit new
Ryan White funds in the amount of
$5,000,000; and

protease inhibitors is that these
therapies are providing improved
overall quality of life for its participants and it may even reduce the
cost of in-patient health care services; and

a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.

supports
a
$4,000,000
increase in the Ohio Department of

to patients unable to afford these
medications and where their physician deems the therapy as medically appropriate.

An emergency resolution to urge
the U.S. Congress support certain
principles and re-authorize funding
for the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA).
Whereas, the Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act of
1991 (ISTEA) was created in part to
distribute
federal
transportation
funds on a regional basis, to efficiently address the diverse regional
demands for transportation infrastructure; and
Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Transportation identifies the Surface Transportation Program “provided unprecedented flexibility to
state and local officials and helped
assure that transportation investments would meet the unique needs
of their communities;” and
Whereas, the major findings of a
Cleveland State University study for
the Greater Cleveland Growth Association
regarding
surface
transportation issues in Greater Cleveland include the need for integration of surface transportation planning with other transportation decisions for cost effective intermodal
linkages,
and
more
consistency
between
regional
transportation
decisions, and regional economic
development strategies; and
Whereas, ISTEA empowered the
Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) as the metropolitan
planning
organization

and 633.99 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
relating to obstruction marking and
lighting for aviation safety.
Whereas,
current
federal
law
requires obstructions 200 feet or
higher to be equipped with aviation
safety lighting and or markings to
promote aviation safety; and
Whereas,
federal
law
also
requires lighting and marking for
some obstructions under 200 feet,
depending on the proximity of the
obstructions to airports; and
Whereas, the proliferation of cellular phones and personal pagers
has resulted in a tremendous growth
of unlighted and unmarked towers,
antennas, and obstructions being
constructed at a height just under
200 feet to meet the increasing
demand of these conveniences; and
Whereas,
these
unlighted
and
unmarked towers, antennas, and
obstructions constitute an extremely
dangerous and potentially deadly
menace to the Aviation Unit night
patrol officers who fly at altitudes
ranging from 100 feet to 300 feet
above the ground, and jeopardize
the safety of the citizens of Cleveland; and
Whereas, construction cranes left
extended upward overnight pose a
similar problem, particularly when
no notice or warning has been made
of the location of these cranes; and
