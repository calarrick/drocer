thirty (30) years and provision for
interest on the unpaid principal of
the loan at a weighted average rate
not greater than six per cent (6%)

shall be paid on the dates and in
the years and amounts approved by

forth in the CDP Loan agreement,
provided that the first principal payment shall be made not later than

Subject to the foregoing, the CDP

event the permanent loan is not

an interest rate different from the
terms for the permanent loan. The

of the City. The CDP Loan may provide for deferral of principal and
interest payments until such dates
as may be negotiated by the Direc-

4
tor of Finance, and may contain
such other loan terms as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to permit the City’s contributions to the costs of the new stadium to be accomplished on terms in
the best interests of the City consistent with the authorizations of
this Council.
The obligations of the City to
repay the CDP Loan shall be evidenced by bonds or other obligations of the City as defined in
Revised Code Section 307.673 (the
“Obligations”).
The
Obligations:
shall be issued in registered form
and shall not be transferrable or
exchangeable
without
the
prior
written consent of the Director of
Finance; shall be issued in the
denominations and shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance; shall be payable as to
principal and interest on the respective dates and in the respective
amounts provided in the CDP Loan;
shall be signed by the Mayor and
the Director of Finance of the City
provided that either or both of those
signatures may be facsimile and
shall bear the seal of the City or a
facsimile thereof. The Director of
Law shall prepare the Obligations
and
shall
endorse
thereon
her
approval of the form and correctness by her manual or facsimile signature. The Director of Finance is
hereby appointed to act as the registrar and paying agent for the
Obligations, and she shall keep all
the books and records necessary for
the registration, transfer and payment of the Obligations. The debt
charges on the Obligations shall be
payable in lawful money of the
United States of America without
deduction for the services of the
registrar as paying agent. Principal
and interest shall be payable when
due upon presentation of the Obligations at the office of the registrar
for her endorsement thereon of the
payments made. The Obligations
may be issued from time to time in
one or more series if so provided in
the CDP Loan. The Obligations
shall be special obligations of the
City and payment of the principal
and interest on the Obligations shall
be made solely from the Nontax
Revenues of the City. As used herein, Nontax Revenues means all moneys of the City which are not moneys raised by taxation, to the extent
available for such purposes, including but not limited to the following:
(a) grants from the United States of
America and the State of Ohio; (b)
payments in lieu of taxes now or
hereafter authorized by State statue; (c) fines and forfeitures which
are deposited in the City’s General
Fund; (d) fees deposited in the
City’s General Fund from properly

of the City that are credited to the
City’s General Fund; (g) proceeds
from the sale of assets which are
deposited in the City’s General
Fund; (h) rental income which is
deposited in the City’s General
Fund; and (i) gifts and donations.”
9. In Section 8, division (c) strike
lines 2 and 3 in their entirety and
insert in lieu thereof “the CDP Loan,
from time to time, if requested to do
so by the Director of Finance.”.
10. In Section 9, line 3, between

The City Record
“instruments” and “as” insert “that
are consistent with the provisions of
this ordinance and”; and in line 4,
strike “, desirable, advisable”.
11. Insert a new Sections 12 and
13 to read as follows:
“Section 12. That the applicable
agreements authorized by this ordinance shall contain provisions consistent with the following:
(a) That any reference to the site
of the new stadium facility shall not
identify a specific site but shall
refer to the following process for
selecting the site between a location
within
the
downtown
Cleveland
lakefront area and a location in
close proximity to the Gateway
Sports Complex Area:
1. The choice of the site for the
new stadium facility between the
two proposed locations shall be
evaluated by a Site Committee consisting of six (6) members: three
members to be appointed by the
Mayor and three members to be
appointed by the City Council. All
appointments shall be made on or
before March 11, 1996. The Site Committee shall be co-chaired by one
member selected by each appointing
authority.
2. The review process by the Site
Committee shall be completed within a forty-five (45) day period commencing on March 12, 1996.
3. In evaluating the two locations,
the Site Committee shall be constrained to choose a location meeting the following criteria:
A. A total estimated project cost
of $230 million, including all hard
and soft costs and all related infrastructure improvements;
B. The timetable established in
the Stadium Finance Agreement;
C. The design criteria established
in the Stadium Finance Agreement;
and
D. A financing package for the
new stadium facility which guarantees a non-municipal contribution,
that is, a contribution exclusive of
municipal and Cleveland Tomorrow
sources, to the project of $28 million
if the project costs a total of $220
million and such contribution to the
project increasing up to $48 million
if the project costs a total of $250
million.
4. The Site Committee shall solicit proposals for alternative uses for
the North Coast Harbor Community
Development Plan Area.
5. Upon completion of its evaluation, the Site Committee shall submit its written recommendation to
the Mayor. With consideration of
the recommendations of the Site
Committee and the NFL Commissioner, the Mayor, in concurrence
with the City Planning Commission,
shall select the site of the new stadium facility.
(b) The City has agreed to provide certain public funds to construct and finance the Stadium and
lease it to the NFL/New Owner.
Such financing consists of a trustee
issuing and selling Certificates of
Participation, in rental payments to
be made by the City under the lease
of the Stadium, as authorized in
Ordinance No. 305-96, an interim borrowing as authorized by Ordinance
No. 306-96, to pay costs of the Stadium pending issuance of the Certificates of Participation; the City
borrowing $10 million from the
Cleveland Development Partners I,
the City allocating utilities funds to
this project and advances made in
anticipation of those transactions
(collectively, the ‘City Financial
Obligation’). It is expressly under-

352

March 14, 1996
stood and agreed that (i) the City’s
obligation to provide financing for
the implementation of the Improvement is limited to its obligations to
create and service the City Financial Obligation and (ii) the City
shall not be deemed or obligated to
incur any cost or expense with
respect to the construction, maintenance or operation of the Stadium
except as expressly provided in the
Franchise Commitment Agreement,
the Stadium Financing Agreement
and the Lease. In addition, the City
and the NFL expressly agree and
understand that the City shall not
be called upon to pay any portion
or advance any funds toward, without limitation, relocation expenses,
funds advanced by the NFL, (except
upon abandonment of the project as
provided in the Stadium Financing
Agreement) training facilities, the
purchase or subsidy of loges, tickets, seat licenses or any other
expense not specifically agreed to
herein;
(c) The Law Director shall use
her best efforts to secure tax-exemption on the Improvement and the
related real property. The NFL shall
be required to cooperate with the
City in the City’s efforts to obtain
an appropriate tax-exemption of the
Improvement.
(d) Any agreement or instrument
which requires notice of any kind to
the City shall include the Cleveland
City Council, and shall be delivered
to the Council President at the following address by the person or
entity required to provide such
notice: Cleveland City Hall, 601
Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio
44114, ATTENTION: Cleveland City
Council President.
(e) The Lessee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to sell naming rights to a telecommunications
company, financial institution, technology company, airline or other
transportation company or major
Cleveland-area
employer.
The
Lessee shall not permit any name to
be given to the New Stadium without prior approval of the City Council, which approval shall not be
withheld unless the proposed name
(i) violates applicable law or (ii)
would reasonably cause embarrassment to the City (such as names
containing slang, barbarisms or profanity, that could be construed to
encourage the use of tobacco or
alcohol by minors, that relate to any
illicit drugs or any sexually oriented business or enterprise, or that
contain an overt political reference). The City shall be deemed to
have given its approval to any name
requested by the Lessee unless,
within thirty (30) days following
the
Lessee’s
request
for
such
approval,
the
City
notifies
the
Lessee of its disapproval and furnishes the reason for such disapproval in reasonable detail.
(f) Within thirty (30) days following the execution of the agreements, and on the 1st day of each
February in 1997 and 1998, the NFL
shall cause NFL Charities to contribute $100,000 per year in cash or,
if agreed to by the City, in equipment to the City for use in the
Cleveland Muny Football Association programs. Upon the granting of
the Cleveland franchise, the NFL
will use good faith efforts to cause
the owner of the new Cleveland
franchise
to
support
Cleveland
municipal youth football programs
at levels mutually agreeable to the
City and the New Owner.
(g) At the inception of the public

March 14, 1996
financing, an amount not less than
Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000)
and not more than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) shall be deposited
in a newly established reserve fund,
which purpose shall be limited to
(i) providing emergency funding for
the Capital Repair Fund and (ii)
any shortfall in revenues to pay the
Certificates of Participation portion
of the City Financial Obligation.
(h) In the event that the new stadium
facility
is
located
within
Downtown
Cleveland
Lakefront
area, the NFL will cause the New
Owner to become a party to the
Common Area Maintenance Agreement between the City, The Port
Authority, The Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame and Museum, Inc., and the
Great Lakes Museum of Science,
Environment and Technology.
(j) All agreements relating to the
Improvement shall state a preference for local products and services,
whether professional or otherwise.
(k)
The
Stadium
Financing
Agreement shall be amended to provide that (i) the Seating Campaign

An emergency ordinance authorizing the Mayor and various Directors to enter into agreements with
the National Football League, Cuyahoga County, Cleveland Develop-

386

March 14, 1996
ment Partnership, Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority and
other entities for the financing, construction,
operation
and
maintenance of a new stadium facility and
the commitment of an NFL franchise to be located in Cleveland and
authorizing and approving related
matters.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
(“City”) has been engaged in litigation
with
Cleveland
Stadium
Corp., the Cleveland Browns, Inc.
and other persons and entities concerning the terms and conditions of
their leases of Cleveland Municipal
Stadium; and
Whereas, the City is prepared to
settle the litigation in consideration
of the payment by Cleveland Stadium Corp. of the City’s damages,
administrative costs and expenses,
and legal fees and in consideration
of certain binding commitments of
the
National
Football
League
(“NFL”) to the City, the most significant of which are: the promise
of the NFL, enforceable by specific
performance, to place an NFL football franchise and owner in Cleveland no later than the first season
of NFL play occurring after construction of a new stadium in Cleveland has been completed; the contribution by the NFL to the costs of
construction of the new stadium in
amounts between Twenty-Eight Million Dollars ($28,000,000) and FortyEight Million Dollars ($48,000,000),
depending on the final construction
budget for the new stadium; the
delivery of the Cleveland Browns
team name, colors, history, records
and heritage to a trust for the benefit of the City and thereafter for
assignment to the new owner of the
Cleveland NFL franchise; the signing and delivery by the NFL of a
lease agreement with the City containing the promises by the NFL
that the Cleveland Browns will play
all regular season home games in
the stadium for not less than 30
years (subject to the option to play
one regular season home game
every two calendar years in a location other than in the Stadium), that
the NFL will cause the new owner
of the Cleveland NFL franchise to
accept the terms of the lease, including the 30-year obligation to play
games in Cleveland and the agreement that the City is entitled to specific performance of that obligation;
and
Whereas, the City wishes to continue to provide for the play of professional football and other public
attractions in the City as a source
of public relaxation and entertainment through the construction, ownership and leasing of a new stadium constituting a “sports facility”
as that term is defined in Sec.
307.673 of the Revised Code (the
“Act”); and
Whereas, the maintenance of public safety and order during the operation of the stadium will require
policing and regulation by the City
which can best be achieved by the
City’s acquisition and construction
of the stadium; and
Whereas, the City has been presented with economic feasibility
reports which conclude that the
acquisition and construction of a
stadium and the leasing of it to a
professional sports team and the
play of NFL football in the facility
will result in the creation of jobs
and employment opportunities and
that a professional football team
will improve the economic welfare
of the City and its people (through

March 14, 1996
increased spending of individuals
residing both inside and outside the
City); and
Whereas,
the
City
has
been
advised of and is aware of additional impacts of a football franchise, including without limitation:
free advertising of the City as a
tourism and business location; community pride and solidarity; and
community relations by encouraging
fans of differing racial, income and
ethnic backgrounds to associate and
cheer for a common cause; and
Whereas, the stadium may be
located in an urban renewal area of
the City and the City’s development
of the stadium in that area and the
lease of the stadium to the NFL and
the new owner will be undertaken
for the foregoing purposes and for
the elimination of conditions of
blight determined to exist in that
area and to prevent the reoccurrence of such conditions of blight;
and
Whereas, the attraction of a professional football team to the City
will not only enrich the City and
serve as a catalyst for development,
but will also project an image of
civic pride and commitment; and
Whereas, the additional non-economic impacts described above are
an essential condition in this Council’s decision to authorize the agreements described in this ordinance;
and
Whereas, in order to receive the
benefits of the NFL commitments
and to attract a professional football team to the City it will be necessary for the City to acquire and
construct a new stadium and to
enter into certain agreements and
financing
arrangements,
all
in
accordance with the Charter of the
City and the Constitution and laws
of the State, including the Act; and
Whereas, in order to acquire and
construct the stadium and for the
City to improve the economic welfare of its people, it is necessary
that the City promptly authorize
and approve the documents authorized hereby and, as a result, this
ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public property, health and safety and for the
usual daily operation of a municipal
department; now therefore.
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

in the preambles to this Ordinance,

An emergency ordinance authorizing the acquisition by lease purchase of a sports facility, authorizing a ground lease and lease purchase agreement with respect to the

Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Ohio (the “City”), a municipal corporation and political subdivision in
and of the State of Ohio (the
“State”) has provided and wishes to
continue to provide a source of public relaxation and entertainment
through the construction and leasing of a sports facility as that term
is defined in Sec. 307.673 of the
Revised Code (the “Act”) for the
playing
of
professional
football
games and the presentation of other
entertainment and public attractions; and
Whereas, the maintenance of public safety and order during the operation of such a sports facility will
require policing and regulation by
the City which can best be achieved
by the City’s acquisition and construction of that sports facility; and
Whereas, the City has reviewed
various economic feasibility reports
which conclude that the acquisition
and construction of such a sports
facility and the leasing of it to a
professional sports team will result
in the creation of jobs and employment opportunities and that a professional football team will improve
the economic welfare of the City
and its people through increased
spending of individuals residing
both inside and outside the City;
and
Whereas, the attraction of a professional football team to the City
would not only enrich the City and
serve as a catalyst for development,
but would also project an image of
civic pride and commitment; and
Whereas, in order to attract a professional football team to the City
it will be necessary for the City to
acquire and construct a new sports
facility; and
Whereas, for the foregoing purposes it has been proposed that

March 14, 1996
Municipal Stadium be demolished
and that the new sports facility be
constructed; and
Whereas, it will be necessary for
the City to enter into certain financing arrangements and other agreements all in accordance with the
Charter of the City and the Constitution and laws of the State, including the Act in order to finance the
cost of a new sports facility; and
Whereas, in order to implement
the financing arrangements with
respect to the sports facility, it will
be necessary for the City to take the
following actions:

Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County
Port
Authority or other Ohio governmental body (the “Lessor”) a leasehold
interest in the real property upon

a term of not more than the term of
the Lease by Way of Concession
between the City and the NFL providing for the lease of the sports
facility to a professional football
team;
B. Execute and deliver a lease
purchase agreement (the “Facility
Lease”) under which the City (a)
will sublease the Facility Site and
lease the sport facility (collectively,
with the Facility Site, the “Leased
Premises”) from the Lessor for an
Initial Term, as defined in the
Facility Lease, and for Renewal
Terms, as defined in the Facility
Lease, upon appropriations being
made by this Council of funds sufficient to enable the City to pay the
Base Rent and Additional Rent, as
defined in the Facility Lease, during the Initial Term and Renewal
Terms (each a “Lease Term”) and
(b) will have an obligation, which
will constitute a “public obligation”
as defined in Ohio Revised Code
Section 133.01, to pay Base Rent and
Additional Rent during each Lease
Term subject to such appropriations;
C. Approve a trust agreement (the
“Trust Agreement”) between the
Lessor and a corporate trustee (the

The City Record
the Trustee;
E. Provide certain information
relating to the sports facility and
the City to the Original Purchaser
for inclusion in a disclosure document to be used in connection with
the initial offering of the Certificates by the Original Purchaser; and
Whereas, in order to acquire and
construct a sports facility and for
the City to improve the economic
welfare of its people, it is necessary
that the City promptly authorize
and approve the Ground Lease, the
Facility Lease, the Trust Agreement
and other documents authorized
hereby and, as a result, this ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public property, health and safety and for the
usual daily operation of a municipal
department; now therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Public Municipal Purpose: It is hereby determined that,
for the reasons set forth in the preambles to this ordinance, the acquisition and financing by the City of
the sports facility pursuant to the
Ground Lease and the Facility
Lease and the use of the sports
facility as a source of public relaxation and entertainment constitute a
public municipal purpose.
Section 2. Ground Lease, Facility
Lease and Trust Agreement. The
Mayor and the Director of Finance
are each authorized and directed to
sign and deliver the Ground Lease
and the Facility Lease and to signify approval of the Trust Agreement in substantially the forms as
are now on file with the Clerk of
Council after approval thereof by
the Director of Law. The Ground
Lease, the Facility Lease and the
Trust Agreement are approved in
substantially the forms as are now
on file with the Clerk of Council,
together
with
any
changes
or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
that are approved by the Mayor and
the Director of Finance and the
Director of Law on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Ground Lease and the Facility
Lease or amendments thereto and
the signifying of approval of the
Trust Agreement or amendments
thereto. This approval of the Trust
Agreement is subject to the consent
of the City (evidenced by the signing of the Letter of Representations) to the appointment of the
Trustee which shall be a trust company or bank having the powers of
a trust company in or outside of the
State and authorized to exercise corporate trust powers in the State and
having a reported capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000.
Section 3. Leased Premises. This
Council hereby determines that the
Leased Premises are essential to the
proper, efficient and economic operation of the City.
Section 4. Determination of Base
Rent and Sale of the Certificates.
(a) Base Rent. The Director of
Finance is hereby authorized and
directed to negotiate and provide
for the terms of the Base Rent, as
defined
in
the
Facility
Lease,
including the aggregate principal
component thereof, which for the
Initial Term and all Renewal Terms
in
aggregate
shall
not
exceed
$175,000,000 and the interest components thereof, which interest components may be fixed rate interest

391

43
components or variable rate interest
components, the weighted average
of which fixed rate interest components shall not exceed 8% per
annum, provided that if the interest
rate component is not to be excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes, the fixed interest
rate
components
shall
not
exceed 12%, and the maximum of
which variable rate interest components shall not exceed 15% per
annum.
The City acknowledges that the
principal component of the Facility
Lease shall be equal to the principal amount of the Certificates and
shall be that amount which, together with other funds to be made
available for the acquisition and
construction of the sports facility,
shall be sufficient to pay the cost
of the sports facility as defined in
Section 307.673(A)(4) of the Act,
including without limitation: the
cost of providing any reserves that
the Director of Finance determines
are necessary and appropriate for
the Certificates to be issued on the
terms most favorable to the City as
the payor on the public obligations
in which the Certificates constitute
fractionalized
interests
(which
determination shall be confirmed by
the Director of Finance by the
Director’s signing of the Letter of
Representations described below);
the cost of funding a renewal and
replacement reserve that may be
used to make payments on the Certificates
and
to
make
capital
improvements to the Leased Premises, which reserve shall be in an
amount determined by the Director
of
Finance
but
not
to
exceed
$5,000,000,
(which
determination
shall be confirmed by the Director
of Finance or the Director’s signing
the
Letter
of
Representations
described below); and the costs of
issuance of the Certificates, which
shall not exceed 4% of the aggregate principal amount of the Certificates (exclusive of any original
issue discount), and which the
Director of Finance determines are
necessary and reasonable in light of
the character of the Certificates
(which determination shall be confirmed by the Director of Finance
by the Director’s execution of the
Letter of Representations). The City
further acknowledges that the payment schedule for the Certificates
shall include interest components on
the principal amount thereof which
shall be based upon the interest
components of the Base Rent. The
Certificates may be issued in one or
more series which may differ as to
interest
rate
components,
credit
enhancement, priority of payment
and other terms. The Base Rent to
be payable under and in accordance
with the Facility Lease during the
Initial Term of the Facility Lease
and any Renewal Terms, shall be
an amount sufficient to cover the
amount of principal of and interest
component on the outstanding Certificates of any series that are due
and payable during that Initial
Term or Renewal Term, and such
Base Rent shall be specified or
determined in an exhibit to the
Facility Lease; provided, however,
that the City’s payment of Base
Rent and Additional Rent is Subject
to Appropriation and Certification
as provided in the Facility Lease
and nothing in the Facility Lease,
the Certificates or the Trust Agreement constitutes a pledge by the
Lessee, or an obligation of the
Lessee, of any taxes or other moneys to the payments due thereunder.

44

Purchase
Agreement.
The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver, in the name and

file with the Clerk of this Council
after approval thereof by the Director of Law, signifying approval of
the Purchase Agreement and setting
forth the schedule of Base Rent and
the principal components and interest components thereof, the costs of
issuance of the Certificates and the
reserves for the Certificates and for
capital improvements and approving
the appointment of the Trustee. The
Purchase Agreement and the Letter
of Representations are approved,
together
with
any
changes
or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance and Director of Law
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Letter of Representations or amendments thereto.

adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance

the improvement described in Section 1 is at least five years, the estimated maximum maturity of the
bonds described in Section 1 is 30
years, and the maximum maturity
of the Notes described in Section 8,
to be issued in anticipation of the
bonds, is 20 years; and
Whereas, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the daily operation of a
municipal department and providing
for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, property, health or
safety in that the issuance of the
Notes and Bonds authorized by this
Ordinance are needed to provide
funds to proceed in a timely manner with the construction of the
sports facility pursuant to City
agreements with the National Football League and to ensure an NFL
franchise will be located in the City
at the earliest possible time; now,
therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Issuance of Bonds. It is
necessary for the reasons set forth
in the preambles to this Ordinance
to issue bonds of this City in the
aggregate principal amount of not
to exceed $20,000,000 (the Bonds) to
pay a portion of the costs of constructing a sports facility, including
the costs of demolition of Municipal
Stadium and site preparation therefor (the “Project”), including costs
of issuance of the Bonds, and to
retire any Notes provided in Section
8 hereof. The Director of Finance
shall
determine
the
principal
amount of the Bonds based on the
amount she determines is necessary
to pay costs of the Project in light
of the anticipated timing of the
issuance of any other obligations to
pay costs of the Project. The principal amount of the Bonds issued
shall be set forth in the certificate
providing for the final terms of the
Bonds and signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this
Ordinance (the Final Terms Certificate). The Notes may be retired
from the proceeds of other obligations issued other than the Bonds or
from other monies available for
such purpose and the Bonds may be
issued to pay costs of the Project
without the prior issuance of the
Notes.
Section 2. Terms of Bonds.
(a) Definitions. In addition to the
words and terms elsewhere defined
in this Ordinance, unless the context
or use clearly indicates another or
different meaning or intent:
“Authorized Denominations” means,
with respect to Capital Appreciation
Bonds, if any, as described below,
the denomination equal to the original principal amount that, when
interest is accrued and compounded
thereon on each Interest Accretion
Date to the stated maturity of the
Bonds, will equal a $5,000 Maturity
Amount or any integral multiple
thereof and, with respect to any
Current Interest Bonds, $5,000 or
any integral multiple thereof.
“Closing Date” means the date of
physical delivery of, and payment of
the purchase price for, the Bonds.
“Compound
Accreted
Amount”
means, with respect to Capital
Appreciation Bonds, if any, the original principal amount thereof plus
interest accrued and compounded on
each Interest Accretion Date to the
date of maturity or other date of
determination.
The
Compound
Accreted Amount per $5,000 Maturi-

393

45
ty Amount of the Capital Appreciation Bonds of each maturity as of
each Interest Accretion Date shall
be set forth in the Final Terms Certificate. The Compound Accreted
Amount of any Capital Appreciation
Bond for each maturity as of any
date other than an Interest Accretion Date is the sum of (a) the Compound Accreted Amount for such
Bond on the immediately preceding
Interest Accretion Date plus (b) the
product
of
(i)
the
difference
between (A) the Compound Accreted Amount of that Bond on the
immediately
preceding
Interest
Accretion Date and (B) the Compound Accreted Amount of that
Bond on the immediately succeeding
Interest Accretion Date, times (ii)
the ratio of (C) the number of days
from the immediately preceding
Interest Accretion Date to the date
of determination to (D) the total
number of days from that immediately preceding Interest Accretion
Date to the immediately succeeding
Interest Accretion Date; provided,
however, that in determining the
Compound Accreted Amount of a
Capital Appreciation Bond as of a
date prior to the first Interest Accretion Date, the Closing Date shall be
deemed to be the immediately preceding Interest Accretion Date and
the original principal amount of
that Bond shall be deemed to be the
Compound Accreted Amount on the
Closing Date.
“Interest Accretion Dates” means,
with respect to Capital Appreciation
Bonds, if any, semi-annual dates
commencing not later than December 1, 1998.
“Interest Payment Dates” means,
with respect to Capital Appreciation
Bonds, if any, the principal and
interest due and payable at the stated maturity of the Bonds.
“Maturity Amount” means, with
respect
to
Capital
Appreciation
Bonds, if any, the principal and
interest due and payable at the stated maturity of that Bond.
“Principal Payment Dates” means
annually on the first day of the
same month each year commencing
no later than December 1, 2006 and
ending no later than December 1,
2030, for a total of not to exceed 30
payments.
(b) General. The Bonds shall be
issued in one lot and only as fully
registered Bonds and shall be dated
no later than December 1, 1997, as
established
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Final Terms Certificate. In accordance with her determination of the best interest of and
financial advantages to the City, the
Director of Finance may designate
in the Final Terms Certificate certain maturities of the Bonds as
“Capital Appreciation Bonds” with
the remaining maturities designated
as the “Current Interest Bonds,” as
further described in this Ordinance.
(c) Interest and Denominations.
The Current Interest Bonds, if any,
shall be issued in an aggregate
principal amount as established by
the Director of Finance in the Final
Terms Certificate, and shall be
issued in denominations of $5,000 or
any integral multiple thereof, but in
no case as to a particular maturity
date exceeding the principal amount
of Current Interest Bonds maturing
on that date. The Current Interest
Bonds shall bear the rate or rates
of interest per year (computed on a
360-day per year basis) as shall be
specified by the Director of Finance
(subject to the parameters set forth
hereafter in this Section) in the

46
Final Terms Certificate; provided,
that the Current Interest Bonds of
any one stated maturity all shall
bear the same rate of interest. Interest on the Current Interest Bonds
shall be payable at such rate or
rates semiannually (the CIB Interest Payment Dates), commencing no
later than December 1, 1998, until
the principal amount has been paid
or provided for. The Current Interest Bonds shall bear interest from
the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for or,
if no interest has been paid or provided for, from their date.
The Capital Appreciation Bonds,
if any, shall be issued in an aggregate principal amount set forth in
the Final Terms Certificate, shall
bear interest from the Closing Date
at the compounding rate or rates of
interest (computed on a 360-day per
year basis), accrued and compounded on each Interest Accretion Date
and payable at maturity, which will
result in the aggregate Maturity
Amounts payable at maturity, as
shall be determined by the Director
of Finance (subject to the parameters set forth hereafter in this Section) in the Final Terms Certificate;
provided, that the Capital Appreciation Bonds of any one stated maturity all shall bear the same compounding rate of interest. The total
interest accrued on any Capital
Appreciation Bond as of any particular date shall be an amount equal
to the amount by which the Compound Accreted Amount of that Capital Appreciation Bond exceeds the
original principal amount of that
Capital Appreciation Bond as of
that
date.
Capital
Appreciation
Bonds shall be issued in Authorized
Denominations, but in no case as to
a particular maturity date exceeding the principal amount maturing
on that date.
The rate or rates of interest per
year to be borne by the Bonds, as
specified by the Director of Finance
in the Final Terms Certificate, shall
be such that the Bonds (taking into
account the Current Interest Bonds
and the Capital Appreciation Bonds,
if any) shall have a True Interest
Rate (as hereinafter defined) not
exceeding 9% per year, provided
that if the interest rate is not to be
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, the True
Interest Rate shall not exceed 11%.
As used in this paragraph, “True
Interest Rate” means the rate determined by doubling the semi-annual
interest rate, computed semi-annually, necessary to discount all payments of principal and interest on
the Bonds to the purchase price of
the Bonds, exclusive of any accrued
interest.
(d)
Principal
Maturities.
The
Bonds shall mature or be payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements (as
hereinafter defined and described)
as specified in the Final Terms Certificate on the Principal Payment
Dates in the principal amounts such
that the total principal and interest
payment on the Bonds in any fiscal
year in which principal is payable
(beginning with the second such
fiscal year) will not be more than
three times the total of the principal and interest payments in the
immediately preceding year.
Consistent with the foregoing and
in accordance with her determination of the best interest of and
financial advantages to the City, the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Final Terms Certificate (i) the

The City Record
principal amount of Bonds, if any,
maturing or payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements on each Principal
Payment Date, (ii) the Principal
Payment Date or Dates, if any, on
which Bonds not subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption (Serial Bonds) shall mature; (iii) the
Principal Payment Date or Dates, if
any, on which Bonds subject to
mandatory sinking fund redemption
(Term Bonds) shall be stated to
mature; (iv) the Principal Payment
Date or Dates on which any Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption (Mandatory Redemption Dates) and (v) the
number of annual Principal Payment Dates (not to exceed 30).
(e) Redemption. The Bonds shall
be subject to redemption prior to
stated maturity as follows:
(i)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption of Term Bonds. Term
Bonds, if any, shall be subject to
mandatory redemption in part by lot
and
be
redeemed
pursuant
to
mandatory sinking fund requirements, at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount of any
Current Interest Bonds or the Compounded Accreted Value of any Capital Appreciation Bonds redeemed,
plus accrued interest to the redemption date, on the applicable Mandatory Redemption Dates and in the
principal amounts payable on those
Dates for which provision is made
above (such Dates and amounts, the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements).
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Bond Registrar (as defined in Section 4 of this
Ordinance) for payment of principal
of and interest on Term Bonds on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
shall include an amount sufficient
to redeem on that Date the principal amount of Term Bonds payable
on that Date pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (less the amount of
any credit as provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Bond Registrar for
cancellation Term Bonds in any
aggregate principal amount and to
receive a credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) of the City for Term
Bonds stated to mature on the same
Principal Payment Date as the
Term Bonds so delivered. That
option shall be exercised by the City
on or before the forty-fifth day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Bond Registrar a certificate, signed
by the Director of Finance, setting
forth the extent of the credit to be
applied with respect to the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement for Term
Bonds stated to mature on the same
Principal Payment Date. If the certificate is not timely furnished to
the Bond Registrar, the applicable
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) shall not be reduced. A credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) also shall be
received by the City for any Term
Bonds which prior thereto have
been redeemed (other than through
the operation of the applicable
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements) or purchased for

394

March 14, 1996
cancellation and canceled by the
Bond Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against
any
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement for
Term Bonds stated to mature on the
same Principal Payment Date as the
Term Bonds so redeemed or purchased and canceled.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Bond Registrar at 100% of the
principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) for Term Bonds
stated to mature on the same Principal Payment Date as the Term
Bonds so delivered, redeemed or purchased and canceled. Any excess of
that amount over the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against any subsequent Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligations) for Term
Bonds stated to mature on that Principal Payment Date, in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(ii) Optional Redemption. If provided by the Director of Finance in
the Final Terms Certificate, the Current Interest Bonds shall be subject
to redemption by and at the sole
option of the City, in whole or in
part in integral multiples of $5,000,
on the dates, in the years and at the
redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount
to be redeemed), plus accrued interest to the redemption date, as determined by the Director of Finance in
the Final Terms Certificate; provided that the earliest optional redemption date shall not be earlier than
December 1, 2006, and the redemption price for the earliest optional
redemption date shall not be greater
than 103%.
If optional redemption of Term
Bonds at a redemption price exceeding 100% of the principal amount to
be redeemed is to take place as of
any Mandatory Redemption Date
applicable to those Term Bonds, the
Term Bonds, or portions thereof, to
be redeemed optionally shall be
selected by lot prior to the selection
by lot of the Term Bonds of the
same maturity to be redeemed on
the same date by operation of the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements. Bonds to be
redeemed pursuant to this paragraph shall be redeemed only upon
written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Bond Registrar,
given upon the direction of this
Council by adoption of a resolution
or passage of an Ordinance. That
notice shall specify the redemption
date and the principal amount of
each maturity of Bonds to be
redeemed, and shall be given at
least 45 days prior to the redemption date or such shorter period as
shall be acceptable to the Bond Registrar.
(iii) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for optional redemption
at one time and Bonds of more than
one maturity are then outstanding,
the Bonds that are called shall be
called as selected by, and selected
in a manner determined by, the
City. If fewer than all of the Bonds
of a single maturity are to be
redeemed, the selection of Bonds of
that maturity to be redeemed, or
portions thereof in amounts of $5,000
or any integral multiple thereof,

March 14, 1996
shall be made by lot in a manner
determined by the Bond Registrar.
In the case of a partial redemption
of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as if it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all, of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then, upon notice of redemption of a $5,000 unit or units, the
registered owner of that Bond shall
surrender the Bond to the Bond Registrar
(i)
for
payment
of
the
redemption price of the $5,000 unit
or units of principal amount called
for redemption (including, without
limitation, the interest accrued to
the date fixed for redemption and
any premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner, of a new Bond or Bonds of
any
authorized
denomination
or
denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unmatured and unredeemed portion of,
and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(iv) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Bond Registrar on behalf of
the City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least 30
days prior to the date fixed for
redemption, to the registered owner
of each Bond subject to redemption
in whole or in part at the registered
owner’s address shown on the Bond
Register (as defined in Section 6 of
this Ordinance) maintained by the
Bond Registrar at the close of business on the fifteenth day preceding
that mailing. Failure to receive
notice by mail or any defect in that
notice regarding any Bond, however, shall not affect the validity of
the proceedings for the redemption
of any Bond.
(v) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
In the event that notice of redemption shall have been given by the
Bond Registrar to the registered
owners as provided above, there
shall be deposited with the Bond
Registrar on or prior to the redemption date, moneys that, in addition
to any other moneys available therefor and held by the Bond Registrar,
will be sufficient to redeem at the
redemption
price
thereof,
plus
accrued interest to the redemption
date, all of the redeemable Bonds
for which notice of redemption has
been given. Notice having been
mailed in the manner provided in
the preceding paragraph hereof, the
Bonds and portions thereof called
for redemption shall become due
and payable on the redemption date,
and, subject to Section 5 of this
Ordinance, upon presentation and
surrender thereof at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid at the redemption price,
plus accrued interest to the redemption date. If moneys for the redemption of all of the Bonds and portions
thereof to be redeemed, together
with accrued interest thereon to the
redemption date, are held by the

The City Record
Bond Registrar on the redemption
date, so as to be available therefor
on that date and, if notice of
redemption has been deposited in
the mail as aforesaid, then from and
after the redemption date those
Bonds and portions thereof called
for redemption shall cease to bear
interest and no longer shall be considered to be outstanding. If those
moneys shall not be so available on
the redemption date, or that notice
shall not have been deposited in the
mail as aforesaid, those Bonds and
portions thereof shall continue to
bear interest, until they are paid, at
the same rate as they would have
borne had they not been called for
redemption. All moneys held by the
Bond Registrar for the redemption
of particular Bonds shall be held in
trust for the account of the registered owners thereof and shall be
paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those
Bonds.
Section 3. Execution of Bonds.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
Mayor and the Director of Finance,
in the name of the City and in their
official capacities, provided that
either or both of those signatures
may be a facsimile, and shall bear
the seal of the City or a facsimile
thereof. Pursuant to Section 83 of
the City’s Charter, the Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon her approval
of the form and correctness by her
manual or facsimile signature. The
Bonds shall be issued in the denominations and numbers as requested
by
the
original
purchaser
and
approved
by
the
Director
of
Finance, shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, and shall express upon
their faces the purpose, in summary terms, for which they are issued
and that they are issued pursuant
to this Ordinance. No Bond shall be
valid or obligatory for any purpose
or shall be entitled to any security
or benefit under this Ordinance
unless and until the certificate of
authentication printed on the Bond
is signed by the Bond Registrar (as
defined in Section 4) as authenticating agent. Authentication by the
Bond Registrar shall be conclusive
evidence that the Bond so authenticated has been duly issued, signed
and delivered under, and is entitled
to the security and benefit of, this
Ordinance.
The
certificate
of
authentication may be signed by
any authorized officer or employee
of the Bond Registrar or by any
other person acting as an agent of
the Bond Registrar and approved by
the Director of Finance on behalf of
the City. The same person need not
sign the certificate of authentication on all of the Bonds.
Section 4. Bond Registrar. The
Director of Finance shall designate
a bank or trust company to act as
the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Bonds (the Bond Registrar) after determining that the
payment at that bank or trust company will not endanger the funds or
securities of the City and that proper procedures and safeguards are
available for that purpose. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, a Bond Registrar Agreement between the City and the Bond
Registrar in a form consistent with
this Ordinance and as approved by
the Director of Law. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and

395

47
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Bond Registrar Agreement from the proceeds
of the Bonds to the extent available
and then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to
be appropriated for that purpose.
Section
5.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges. The debt charges on the
Bonds shall be payable in lawful
money of the United States of America without deduction for the services of the Bond Registrar as paying agent. Principal and any premium on the Current Interest Bonds
shall be payable when due upon presentation and surrender of the
Bonds at the principal corporate
trust office of the Bond Registrar.
Interest on a Current Interest Bond
shall be paid on each CIB Interest
Payment Date by check or draft
mailed to the person in whose name
the Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section 6) at the close of business on
the 15th day of the calendar month
next preceding that Interest Payment Date (the Record Date). The
debt charges on the Capital Appreciation Bonds shall be payable when
due upon presentation and surrender of the Capital Appreciation
Bonds at the principal corporate
trust office of the Bond Registrar.
Section 6. Transfer and Exchange
of Bonds. So long as any of the
Bonds remain outstanding, the City
will cause the Bond Registrar to
maintain and keep at its principal
corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration,
exchange
and
transfer
of
Bonds as provided in this Section
(the Bond Register). Subject to the
provisions of Section 5, the person
in whose name a Bond is registered
on the Bond Register shall be
regarded as the absolute owner of
that Bond for all purposes of this
Ordinance.
Payment
of
or
on
account of the debt charges on any
Bond shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Bond Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any Authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Bond Registrar, together with a request for exchange
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to
do so in a form satisfactory to the
Bond Registrar. A Bond may be
transferred only on the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond at the principal corporate trust office of the Bond Registrar together with an assignment
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to
do so in a form satisfactory to the
Bond Registrar. Upon exchange or
transfer the Bond Registrar shall
complete, authenticate and deliver a
new Bond or Bonds of any Authorized Denomination or Denominations requested by the owner equal
in the aggregate to the unmatured
principal amount of the Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the
same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of

48
the City are required, the Bond Registrar shall undertake the exchange
or transfer of Bonds only after the
new Bonds are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Bonds exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the
Bond Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver Bonds in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and
Bond Registrar may make a charge
sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Bond Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for
the exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
special obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under this Ordinance, as the Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer. Neither the City nor the
Bond Registrar shall be required to
make any exchange or transfer of a
Bond during the period beginning at
the opening of business 15 days
before the day of the mailing of a
notice of redemption of Bonds and
ending at the close of business on
the day of such mailing or to transfer or exchange any Bond selected
for redemption, in whole or in part.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be in the best interests
of and financially advantageous to
the City, the Bonds may be issued
in book entry form in accordance
with the provisions of this Section.
As used in this Section and this
Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants
or otherwise, a book entry system
to record ownership of beneficial
interests in Bonds or the principal
and interest, and to effect transfers
of Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized, (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the form
of a single, fully registered Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered

The City Record
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Director of Finance, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the Bonds from
the Depository, and authenticate
and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.

transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments, including
but not limited to interest rate

Section 8. Issuance of Notes. It is
necessary for the reasons set forth
in the preambles to this Ordinance
to issue and this Council determines
that notes in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $20,000,000
(the Notes) shall be issued in anticipation of the issuance of the Bonds.
The Notes shall bear interest at a
rate or rates not to exceed 7% per
year (computed on a 360-day per
year basis), payable at maturity or
at any date of earlier prepayment
as provided for in Section 9 of this
Ordinance and until the principal
amount is paid or payment is provided for. The rate or rates of interest on the Notes shall be determined
by the Director of Finance in the
certificate or certificates awarding
the Notes in accordance with Section
11 of this Ordinance (the Certificate
of Award). The Notes may be issued
from time to time in one or more
series if so provided in the Certificate of Award, provided that a separate Certificate of Award shall be
executed for each series and the
last series of Notes shall be authorized and sold not later than December 31, 1997.
Section 9. Payment of Principal.
The debt charges on the Notes shall
be payable in lawful money of the
United States of America, or in Federal Reserve funds of the United
States of America if so requested by
the Original Purchaser, and shall be
payable, without deduction for services of any paying agent. The
Director of Finance may serve as
the City’s paying agent for the
Notes or the Director of Finance
shall designate a bank or trust company to serve as the City’s paying
agent (the Paying Agent) after
determining that payment at that
bank or trust company will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and that proper procedures
and safeguards are available for
that purpose. The Notes of each
series shall be dated the date of
issuance of the respective series and
shall mature on a date to be determined in the Certificate of Award
for the respective series, provided
that such date shall not be later
than twelve months from the date
of issuance of the respective series
of Notes. If agreed to by the Original Purchaser, the Notes shall be
prepayable without penalty or premium at the option of the City at
any time prior to maturity as pro-

March 14, 1996
vided in this Ordinance. Prepayment
prior to maturity shall be made by
deposit with the Paying Agent of
the principal amount of the Notes
together with interest accrued thereon to the date of prepayment. The
City’s right of prepayment shall be
exercised by mailing a notice of prepayment, stating the date of prepayment and the name and address
of the Paying Agent, by certified or
registered mail to the original purchaser of the Notes not less than
seven days prior to the date of that
deposit, unless that notice is waived
by the original purchaser of the
Notes. If money for prepayment is
on deposit with the Paying Agent
on the specified prepayment date
following the giving of that notice
(unless the requirement of that
notice is waived as stated above),
interest on the principal amount prepaid shall cease to accrue on the
prepayment date, and upon the
request of the Director of Finance
the Original Purchaser of the Notes
shall arrange for the delivery of the
Notes at the designated office of the
Paying Agent for prepayment and
surrender and cancellation.
Section 10. Execution of Notes.

fully registered securities in accordance with Section 133.40 of the
Revised Code and in book-entry or
other certificated form in accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Revised Code if it is determined by
the Director of Finance that the
issuance of fully registered securities in that form will facilitate the
sale and delivery of the Notes. The
Notes may be issued in the denominations of $100,000 each or in any
denomination that is the sum of (i)
$100,000 and (ii) $5,000 or any whole

to this Ordinance.
Section 11A. Sale of Notes. The
Notes shall first be offered at par

of the Sinking Fund and, if the
Trustees refuse to take any or all
of them, the Director of Finance
shall offer them to the Mayor and
the Director of Law for purchase for

best interest of the City, to combine

other note issues of the City into a

Section 133.30(B) of the Revised
Code.
Section 11B. Security. The Bonds
and the Notes are special obligations of the City, and the principal

Bonds, such payment is secured by
a pledge of those Nontax Revenues
established by and as provided in
this Ordinance which are on deposit
in the Stadium Bond Fund, as
described below.
There is hereby created by the
City a separate fund named the
“Stadium Bond Fund” (the “Bond
Fund”) into which Nontax Revenues
shall be deposited in accordance
with the following provisions. “Nontax Revenues”, as used herein,

the following: (a) grants from the
United States of America and the
State of Ohio; (b) payments in lieu
of taxes now or hereafter authorized by State statute; (c) fines and
forfeitures which are deposited in
the City’s General Fund; (d) fees
deposited in the City’s General Fund

credited to the City’s General Fund;
(g) proceeds from the sale of assets
which are deposited in the City’s
General Fund; (h) rental income

the Bonds or the first day of the
sixth month preceding the first CIB

397

49
Moneys in the Bond Fund shall be
used solely and exclusively to pay
principal and interest on the Bond
when due.
The City hereby covenants and
agrees that so long as the Notes and
the Bonds are outstanding, it will
appropriate and maintain sufficient
Nontax Revenues each year to make
each payment due under this Section and to pay principal and interest on the Notes and Bonds when
due; provided, however, the payments due hereunder and under the
Notes and Bonds are payable solely
from Nontax Revenues, which Nontax Revenues are hereby selected
by the City as moneys that are not
raised by taxation. The Notes and
Bonds do not and shall not represent or constitute a debt or pledge
of the faith or credit or taxing
power of the City, and the owners
of the Bonds have no right to have
taxes levied by the City for the payment of principal and interest on
the Bond.
Nothing herein shall be construed
as requiring the City to use or apply
to the payment of principal and
interest on the Notes or the Bonds
any funds or revenues from any
source other than Nontax Revenues.
Nothing herein, however, shall be
deemed to prohibit the City, of its
own volition, from using, to the
extent that it is authorized by law
to do so, any other resources for the
fulfillment of any of the terms, conditions or obligations of this Ordinance or of the Notes or the Bonds.
Section 12. Proceeds of Notes and
Bonds. The proceeds from the sale
of the Notes or Bonds, except any
premium and accrued interest, shall
be paid into the proper fund or
funds and those proceeds are appropriated and shall be used for the
purpose for which the Notes or
Bonds are being issued. Any portion
of those proceeds representing premium and accrued interest shall be
paid into the Sinking Fund.
If Notes are issued, the par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds or any renewal notes and any
excess funds resulting from the
issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used to pay the
debt charges on the Notes at maturity and are pledged for that purpose.
Section 13. Disclosure; Rating;
Insurance. If, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance after consultation with the Original Purchaser, an
official statement or other disclosure document is appropriate relating to the initial offering of the
Notes or Bonds, the Director of
Finance, on behalf of the City and
in that officer’s official capacity, is
authorized to (i) cooperate with the
Original Purchaser in the preparation of, and the making of modifications, completions or changes of

document, (ii) determine, and to certify or otherwise represent, when
the disclosure document is to be

disclosure document and any supplements thereto in connection with
the initial offering of the Notes or
Bonds, and (iv) sign certificates,
statements or other documents in
connection with the finality, accuracy and completeness of that disclosure document.

beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or Bonds, the City
agrees, as the only obligated person
with respect to the Notes or Bonds

50
under SEC Rule 15c2-12 (the “Rule”),
to provide or cause to be provided
such financial information and operating data, audited financial statements and notices, in such manner,
as may be required for purposes of
paragraph (b)(5)(i) of the Rule. In

terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose,
and thereby to implement that
agreement, including provisions for
enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, the Continuing Disclosure Certificate with respect to the
Bonds and, if required under the
Rule, with respect to the Notes, in
substantially the form as is now on
file with the Clerk of Council after
approval thereof by the Director of
Law, with such modifications as
may be appropriate under the Rule
in connection with the issuance of
Notes, and with any changes or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance and the Director of
Law on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of that Certificate or amendments to it. The
agreement formed, collectively, by
this paragraph and that Certificate,
shall be the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for purposes of
the Rule, and its performance shall
be subject to the annual appropriation of any funds that may be necessary to perform it.
If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance after consultation
with the Original Purchaser, the filing of an application for (i) a rating on the Notes or Bonds by one or
more nationally-recognized rating
agencies, (ii) a policy of insurance
or other credit enhancement facility
from a company or companies to
better assure the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes or

interest of and financially advantageous to this City, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications, to
provide to each such agency, company or other credit enhancement
facility provider such information
as may be required for the purpose.
The cost of obtaining each such rating, policy, bond or credit enhancement facility, except to the extent
paid by the Original Purchaser in
accordance with the Bond Purchase
Agreement, shall be paid from the
proceeds of the Notes or Bonds.
Section 14. Tax Covenants. The
City covenants that it will use, and
will restrict the use and investment
of, the proceeds of the Notes and
Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) neither the Notes nor the Bonds
will (i) constitute private activity
bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii)
be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest on the
Notes and Bonds will not be treated
as an item of tax preference under
Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken

The City Record
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and Bonds to be and remain excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes, (b) it will not
take or authorize to be taken any
actions that would adversely affect
that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons
acting for it, will, among other acts
of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the Notes and Bonds to the
governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment
property,
(iii)
make
timely and adequate payments to
the federal government, (iv) maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those
proceeds, and, as applicable, of property financed with such proceeds,
all in such manner and to the extent
necessary to assure such exclusion
of that interest under the Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes and Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and Bonds as
the City is permitted to or required
to make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided

treatment or status of the Notes and
Bonds or interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements
for that purpose, reducing the burden or expense of such compliance,
reducing the rebate amount or payments or penalties, or making payments of special amounts in lieu of
making computations to determine,
or
paying,
excess
earnings
as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclusion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
Notes and Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes

regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds of the Notes and Bonds,
the facts, circumstances and estimates on which they are based, and
other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Notes and Bonds.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provisions of this Ordinance to the contrary, if the Director of Finance determines prior to
the execution and delivery of the
Bond Purchase Agreement that it is
necessary and appropriate and in
the best interests of the City for the
interest on the Notes or the Bonds
to be included in gross income for
federal income tax purposes, the
City shall not be bound by the
covenants of this Section 14 with
respect to the Notes or Bonds, as the
case may be.
