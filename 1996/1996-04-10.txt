heretofore duly passed an ordinance
(the “Series H Bond Legislation”)
authorizing the issuance by the City
(the

of

1996 (the “Series H Bonds”) in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed $175,000,000 with respect to

an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed $100,000,000 with respect
to Refunding Bonds (except, in each

service savings for the benefit of,
its Waterworks System and thereby
provide for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

forth the date, location, procedure
and conditions for the delivery of
the Series H Bonds, including, without limitation any conditions relating to the obtaining of any insurance policy to enhance the security

executing the Bond Purchase Agreement on behalf of the Issuer determine serves the best interest of the
Issuer by achieving a net reduction
in the aggregate Debt Service that
will be payable on the aggregate of
the Series H Bonds from the Debt
Service
that
would
be
payable
thereon were no such insurance
obtained.
The
Bond
Purchase
Agreement shall be substantially in

Series H Bond Legislation or the
Series H Resolution of Award and
not substantially adverse to the
Issuer as may be approved by the
officers executing the same on

of any such changes by such officers and the determination by such
officers that no such change is substantially adverse to the Issuer
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the execution of the Bond Purchase
Agreement by such officers.
The
Mayor, the Director of Finance, the
Director of Public Utilities and the
Director of Law are hereby further
authorized and directed to take all
steps necessary to effect the due
authentication, delivery and security of the Series H Bonds in accordance with the terms of the Mortgage, the Series H Bond Legislation,
the Series H Resolution of Award
and the Bond Purchase Agreement.

the Series H Bonds with any other
qualified Depository.

Series H Bonds shall be issued in

preparation of definitive Series H
Bonds.
(c) Interest and Place of Payment. The Series H Bonds shall bear

Fourth
Supplemental Mortgage, the Fifth
Supplemental Mortgage, the Sixth
Supplemental Mortgage and as further amended and supplemented
pursuant to the authority of the
Bond Legislation and this Series H
Bond Legislation, the Mayor, Director of Finance and Director of Public Utilities, or any two of them, are
hereby authorized and directed, in

22
the name and on behalf of the
Issuer, to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Trustee, in
trust for the Original Purchasers
and subsequent holders of the Series
H Bonds, a good and sufficient Seventh
Supplemental
Mortgage,
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, substantially in the form now on file with the
Clerk in the File referenced in Section 6 hereof, with such changes
therein or thereto not inconsistent
with the Original Mortgage as
amended and supplemented by the
First Supplemental Mortgage, the
Second Supplemental Mortgage, the
Third Supplemental Mortgage, the
Fourth Supplemental Mortgage, the
Fifth Supplemental Mortgage, the
Sixth Supplemental Mortgage and
the Series H Bond Legislation and
not substantially adverse to the
Issuer as may be approved by the
officers executing the same on
behalf of the Issuer. The approval
of any such changes by such officers and the determination by such
officers that no such change is substantially adverse to the Issuer
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the execution of the Seventh Supplemental Mortgage by such officers. The Series H Bond Legislation
shall constitute a part of the Seventh Supplemental Mortgage, and
National City Bank, Cleveland, Ohio,
shall continue to serve as Trustee
under the Mortgage and shall signify its acceptance of the duties and
obligations of the Trustee under the
Seventh Supplemental Mortgage by
executing the Seventh Supplemental
Mortgage.
In order to cause the proceeds of
the Series H Bonds deposited in the
Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 4
hereof to be invested as required
under Section 12.2 of the Mortgage
so that the Refunded Bonds are
deemed paid and discharged, and in
order to cause the amount to be
deposited
to
be
dedicated
and
applied in accordance with the
terms thereof to the payment of the
principal of and interest and any
redemption premium on the Refunded Bonds as and when due, to and
including the Redemption Date, the
Mayor, Director of Finance and
Director of Public Utilities, or any
two of them, are hereby authorized
and directed, in the name and on
behalf of the City, to make, execute,
acknowledge and deliver an Escrow
Agreement between the Issuer and
the
Trustee
as
Escrow
Agent,
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, providing
for the establishment of the Escrow
Fund as a trust fund in the custody
of the Trustee and the investment,
dedication and application of the
moneys deposited in the accounts
therein for the above-described purposes and further providing for the
payment of the fees and expenses
of the Trustee for the performance
of its fiduciary duties as Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agreement shall
provide for the redemption of those
Refunded Bonds subject to redemption in accordance with the Mortgage and shall provide irrevocable
instruction to the Trustee to effect
such redemption at the earliest possible date including instructions for
the notification of Bondholders. The
Mayor, Director of Finance and the
Director of Public Utilities, or any
two of them, are authorized, in the
name and on behalf of the Issuer,
to make, execute, acknowledge and
deliver agreements, approved as to
form and correctness by the Direc-

The City Record
tor of Law, with one or more institutions, including agreements which
will enable the Issuer to more efficiently structure the Escrow Fund,
and thereby maximize debt service
savings and minimize negative arbitrage. The Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to take such
other actions as may be necessary
or appropriate to accomplish the
refunding of the Refunded Bonds
including without limitation, the
retention of a firm of independent
certified public accountants to verify that the federal securities to be
in the Escrow Fund are of such
maturities or redemption dates, and
interest payment dates, and bear
such interest, as will be sufficient,
together with any available moneys
in the Escrow Fund, for the payment of Debt Service on the Refunded Bonds.
Section 7. Rebate Fund. There is
hereby established and ordered to
be maintained a separate account
(except when invested as provided
in the Indenture), designated the
Series H Account, within the Rebate
Fund established pursuant to the
Series E Bond Legislation and held
in the custody of the Trustee. Any
provision hereof or of the Mortgage
to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Rebate Fund is not pledged to the
payment of Debt Service, is not one
of or part of any of the Funds, and
is free and clear of the pledge or
lien under the Mortgage. Calculations of excess earnings that may
be due and payable to the federal
government pursuant to the Code
and
deposits
to
the
Series
H
Account of the Rebate Fund shall
be made as provided in the Seventh
Supplemental Mortgage.
Section 8. Incorporation of Bond
Legislation. It is understood and
acknowledged that the Series H
Bonds are being issued pursuant to
and in accordance with the terms of
the Bond Legislation and of the
Series H Bond Legislation, and that
the Series H Bonds are subject to
the terms and conditions of the
Bond Legislation except to the
extent that such terms and conditions are modified or amended by or
pursuant to the Series H Bond Legislation.
All
terms,
conditions,
covenants and warranties contained
in the Bond Legislation, except as
otherwise provided in or pursuant to
the Series H Bond Legislation, shall
apply with like force and effect to
the Series H Bonds as if originally
made
in
connection
with
the
issuance thereof.
Section 9. Interest Rate Exchange
Agreement. This Council finds that
by engaging in interest rate swap
transactions, from time to time, the
Issuer can, in effect, convert interest on all or a portion of the Series
H Bonds from a fixed rate to a
floating rate, or from a floating rate
to a fixed rate, and thereby may
reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative amounts of
fixed and floating rate obligations
from time to time and minimizing
the risk of variations in its debt service costs. To permit the Issuer to
have the flexibility to undertake
such interest rate swap transactions
and to establish the procedures for
approving such transactions, this
Council authorizes the execution
and delivery of an Interest Rate
Exchange Agreement (the “Rate
Exchange Agreement”) and any
related agreements necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Rate
Exchange Agreement.

598

April 10, 1996
Upon the recommendation of the
financial advisor of the Issuer to
the Director of Finance that an
interest rate swap transaction be
undertaken by the Issuer, the Director of Finance may authorize such
an interest rate swap transaction in
accordance with the Rate Exchange
Agreement; provided that (a) the
maximum
aggregate
notional
amount of interest rate swap transactions outstanding at any one time,
net of offsetting interest rate swap
transactions, shall not exceed an
amount equal to the greater of (i)
twenty percent of the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of all
Outstanding Revenue Bonds issued
under the Mortgage, or (ii) such
amount as will not result in a lowering of the ratings assigned to the
Outstanding Revenue Bonds by the
rating agencies, as is evidenced by
written correspondence from the rating agencies or policies published in
writing by the rating agencies and
(b) the term of each interest rate
swap transaction shall not exceed
30 years. The aggregate amount of
all such rate interest swap transactions in effect as of any time shall
be determined on a net basis; that
is, where any such transaction is
entered into to offset or reverse an
earlier transaction, to the extent of
the offsetting or reversing effect,
the amounts of such offsetting or
reversing interest rate swap transactions shall not be included in the
aggregate total. The approval of
each interest rate swap transaction
by the Director of Finance shall be
conclusively evidenced by the execution of the applicable interest rate
swap transaction by the Director of
Finance or any other person duly
authorized by this Council to execute interest rate swap transactions.
The Issuer may pay any amounts
due
under
the
Rate
Exchange
Agreement and the interest rate
swap transactions from the Net Revenues of the Waterworks System
held in or for the credit of the Additions and Improvements Fund under
the Original Mortgage, as supplemented, and any other available
moneys of the Issuer permitted by
law to be used for the purpose of
making those payments. Nothing in
the Rate Exchange Agreement or
the interest rate swap transactions,
however, shall be deemed to prohibit the Issuer from using, of its
own volition, to the extent that it is
authorized by law to do so, any
other resources for the fulfillment
of any of the terms and conditions
of or its obligations under the Rate
Exchange Agreement or the interest
rate swap transactions.
Anything in this Series H Bond
Legislation,
the
Rate
Exchange
Agreement or any interest rate
swap transaction to the contrary
notwithstanding, the obligation of
the Issuer to make payments under
the Rate Exchange Agreement and
any interest rate swap transaction
does not and shall not represent or
constitute
a
general
obligation,
debt, bonded indebtedness or a
pledge of the faith and credit of the
Issuer, the State of Ohio or any
other political subdivision thereof.
Nothing herein gives any party to
the Rate Exchange Agreement the
right to have excises, ad valorem or
other taxes levied by the Issuer or
the State of Ohio or by the taxing
authority of any other political subdivision for the payment of any
amounts
due
under
the
Rate
Exchange Agreement and the interest rate swap transactions.

April 10, 1996

agrees with the Holders of the

Refunded Bonds, and to pay costs
relating to the issuance of the

(b) The Clerk, or other appropriate officer of the Issuer, will furnish to the Original Purchasers and
to the Trustee a true transcript of
proceedings, certified by the Clerk
or other officer, of all proceedings
had with reference to the issuance

such information from the Issuer’s
records as is necessary to determine
the regularity and validity of such
issuance.
(c) The Issuer will, at any and all
times, cause to be done all such further acts and things and cause to
be executed and delivered all such
further instruments as may be necessary to carry out the purpose of
the Series H Bonds and the Series
H Bond Legislation or as may be
required by Section 13, Article XVIII
of the Constitution of Ohio and the
Charter of the Issuer and will comply with all requirements of law
applicable to the Waterworks System and the operation thereof.
(d) The Issuer will observe and
perform all its agreements and
obligations provided for in the
Series H Bonds, the Mortgage or the

Supplemental Mortgage are hereby
established as duties specifically
enjoined by law and resulting from
an office, trust or station upon the
Issuer within the meaning of Section 2731.01, Ohio Revised Code.
(e) The Issuer will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the Series H Bonds
in such manner and to such extent
as may be necessary so that (a) the
Series H Bonds will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Code
or (ii) be treated other than as
bonds to which Section 103(a) of the
Code applies, and (b) the interest
thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code.
(f) The Issuer hereby covenants
that (a) it will take or cause to be
taken such actions that may be
required of it for the interest on the
Series H Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Series H Bonds
to the governmental purpose of the
borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment property acquired with
those proceeds, (iii) make timely
rebate payments to the federal government, (iv) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports, and (v) refrain from certain
uses of proceeds, and, as applicable,
of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Series H

The City Record
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues for which any portion of
the Debt Service is paid from proceeds of the Series H Bonds (and, if
different, the original issue and any
refunding issues in a series of
refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Series
H Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the
Director of Finance, or any other
officer having responsibility with
respect to the Series H Bonds, are
authorized to take such actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take
with respect to the Series H Bonds.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance or any other officer of the
Issuer having responsibility for the
issuance of the Series H Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the Issuer with
respect to the Series H Bonds as the
Issuer is permitted or required to
make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections provided for, or available
under, Section 148 of the Code, for
the purpose of assuring, enhancing
or protecting favorable tax treatment or status of the Series H
Bonds or interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements
for that purpose, reducing the burden or expense of such compliance,
reducing the rebate amount or payments of penalties, or making payments of special amounts in lieu of
making computations to determine,
or
paying,
excess
earnings
as
rebate, or obviating those amount or
payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer
and (b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the Issuer, as
may be appropriate to assure the
exclusion of interest from gross
income and the intended tax status
of the Series H Bonds. The Director
of Finance or any other officer or
employee or consultant to the Issuer
having responsibility with respect
to the issuance of the Series H
Bonds, alone or in conjunction with
any other officer or employee of or
consultant of the Issuer shall give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the Issuer, for inclusion in the
transcript of proceedings for the
Series H Bonds, setting forth the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
Issuer regarding the amount and
use of all the proceeds of the Series
H Bonds, the facts, circumstances
and estimates on which they are
based, and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the interest on and the tax
status of the Series H Bonds.
Section 11. Authorization of Bond
Rating and Credit Enhancement. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, the filing of applications
for one or more ratings on the
Series H Bonds by one or more
nationally recognized rating agencies and for a credit enhancement
facility (including, without limitation, a policy of municipal bond
insurance) are necessary or desirable for marketing purposes, the
Director of Finance, in her official
capacity, is hereby authorized to
prepare and submit any or all of
those applications, to provide such
information as may be required in

599

23
support thereof and to provide further for the payment of the costs of
such ratings or credit facility from
funds to be appropriated for the purpose if and to the extent that such
payment shall not be made by the
Original Purchaser.

12.

Eighth Supplemental Indenture (the
Amended and Restated Indenture).
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.2 of the Original Mortgage,
which provides that the holders of
