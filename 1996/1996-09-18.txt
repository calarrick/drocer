Res. No. 1722-96.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the federal government to provide
drug treatment programs and economic development opportunities to
black neighborhoods affected by
illegal drug trafficking by the CIA
during the early 1980s.
Whereas, this Council is shocked
by recent revelations in the newspapers linking the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) to the
introduction of crack cocaine into
black neighborhoods in order to
raise funds to support the CIAbacked Nicaraguan Contra army in
the early 1980s; and
Whereas,
according
to
these
reports, the CIA-backed drug network was responsible for introducing and selling crack cocaine in a
number of U.S. cities, including
Cleveland; and
Whereas, this purported misuse of
governmental power by a federal
agency must be thoroughly investigated and remedied; and
Whereas, at a minimum, the federal government must provide funding to combat drugs in the same
communities in which it reportedly
trafficked in illegal drugs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health, or safety in that only by taking immediate actions can the federal government hope to remedy the
wrongs set forth in the press
reports; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the federal government to provide
drug treatment programs and economic development opportunities to
black neighborhoods affected by
reported illegal drug trafficking by
the CIA during the early 1980s.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit

1785

11
copies of this resolution to President Clinton, the President of the
U.S. Senate, the Speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives and the
members of the U.S. Congressional
delegation from Greater Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Motion to suspend rules. Charter
and statutory provisions and place
