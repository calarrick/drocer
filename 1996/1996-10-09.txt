By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution opposing
passage of HR 1020/S. 1271 which
could lead to the transport by railway and highway of high level
radioactive waste from other states
through the Cleveland area, or failing the above, to amend these bills
to provide additional provisions.

1919

15
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland has been advised of
legislation pending before the U.S.
Congress,
HR
1020/S.
1271,
the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1995,
which could lead to the transport by
railway and highway of shipments
of high level radioactive waste from
other states through the Cleveland
area; and
Whereas, the City Council and the
appropriate City departments have
attempted to inform themselves of
the procedures to be used in these
shipments and have taken all available precautions within their power;
and
Whereas, in spite of assurances
by responsible federal and state
officials that shipment procedures
are safe, there remain questions
still unanswered regarding these
procedures; and
Whereas, it is clear that the shipment of nuclear waste materials
through the City of Cleveland represents an undesirable risk in the
event of a catastrophic and unpredictable railway or highway accident; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that the City of
Cleveland
is
without
sufficient
emergency
personnel,
equipment
and financial resources to safeguard
its residents in the event of a major
nuclear transport accident; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes passage of HR 1020/S.
1271 and urges the members of the
General Assembly to vote against
this threat to public health.
Section 2. That failing Section 1
of this resolution, to urge the members of the Senate and the General
Assembly to support an amendment
to these bills include the following:
1) to bar any shipment of irradiated fuel rods through the metropolitan Cleveland area until a deep-geological repository is available for
permanent disposal; 2) to require
the responsible federal agency or
agencies
to
provide
a
written
description with citations of Federal Regulations which justify the
routing of this high level radioactive waste shipments through highly populated areas; and 3) to indemnify the City of Cleveland from
accepting any liability for a risk of
this magnitude for its residents or
their properties.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Voinovich, the appropriate state and
federal agencies and to the Speaker
of the House of Representatives, the
President of the Senate and the Ohio
members of the United States Senate and the House of Representatives.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

Res. No. 1846-96.
By Councilman O’Malley.
An emergency resolution calling
upon the Israeli and Palestinian
leadership to heed United Nations
Security Council Resolution No. 1073
(1996) which calls for an immediate
reversal of all acts aggravating the
situation in Jerusalem, the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip and urging the immediate resumption of
peace negotiations within the Middle East.
Whereas,
recent
events
in
Jerusalem, the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip and clashes between the
Israeli army and the Palestinian
police have prompted the United
Nations Security Council (“Security
Council”) to call for an immediate
cessation and reversal of all acts
which have aggravated the situation in the Middle East and which
have negative implications for the
Middle East peace process; and
Whereas, these events have directly or indirectly caused many deaths,
injuries and casualties on both sides
resulting from clashes between the
Israeli army and the Palestinian
police; and
Whereas, on September 26, 1996, a
representative of Saudi Arabia, on
behalf of the League of Arab States,
sent the Security Council a letter
asking
the
Security
Council
to
address the recent escalation of violence and events in the Middle East;
and
Whereas, on September 28, 1996,
the Security Council adopted Resolution No. 1073 (1996) which, among
other things, called for the immediate cessation and reversal of all
acts which have resulted in the
aggravation of the situation, and
which have negative implications
for the Middle East peace process
and, also, called for the safety and
protection of Palestinian civilians to
be ensured; and
Whereas, difficulties facing the
Middle East peace process, and the
deterioration
of
the
situation,
including inter alia its impact on
the living conditions of the Palestinian people, would be further abated if all parties would fulfill their
obligations
reached
in
previous
agreements; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that the continuance of this dispute is likely to
endanger international peace and
security; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the Israeli and Palestinian leadership to heed Resolution
No.
1073
(1996)
of
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
which,
among other things, calls for the
immediate cessation and reversal of
all acts which have resulted in the
aggravation of the situation in the
Middle East, and which have negative implications for the Middle
East peace process, and, further,
calls for the safety and protection
of
Palestinian
civilians
to
be
ensured.
Section 2. That this Council urges
an immediate resumption of negotiations of the parties involved in the
Middle East peace process and a
timely implementation of all agreements reached.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to the Israeli
and Palestinian representatives to

The City Record
the United Nations and to the representatives of each member nation
to the Security Council of the United Nations.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

shall take effect and be in force

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 375-96.
By Councilman Melena.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor and the Administration to
plan for the utilization of clean
material from the demolition of
Cleveland
Municipal
Stadium
to
expand the Cuyahoga County Commissioners Reef or build new reefs
in order to create the largest freshwater artificial reef system in the
world.
Whereas, since the late 1700’s the
Japanese have successfully used
artificial reef technology to create
and
enhance
coastal
fishing
grounds; and
Whereas, the Western Basin of
Lake Erie is known as the “Walleye Capital of the World” because
this area produces more walleye per
hectare than any other lake in the
world; and
Whereas, the Western Basin is
shallow and dotted with islands and
natural reefs which provide necessary habitat for many fish species
including bass, perch and walleye;
and
Whereas, the Central Basin is
deeper, larger and lacks the necessary near shore productive bottom
structures nature provided the Western Basin; and
Whereas, since the central basin
lacks the near shore structures necessary to fish habitats the Central
Basin fishing areas are not within
safe running distance for smaller
boats; and
Whereas, in the 1980’s the North
Central Ohio Sea Grant Committee
caused the creation of artificial
reefs in Lake Erie off the coast of
Lorain and Cuyahoga Counties; and
Whereas, in 1984 the Cuyahoga
County Commissioners contributed
$62,500.00 towards the artificial reef
off the Cuyahoga County Coast; and
Whereas, said artificial reef is
known as the “Cuyahoga County
Commissioner’s Reef”; and
Whereas, in 1984, the Cuyahoga
County
Commissioners
estimated
that the artificial reef off the Cuyahoga County Coast was expected to
inject over 50 million dollars into
the local economy; and
Whereas, studies of the Cuyahoga
County Commissioner’s Reef have
shown the reef to have exceeded
expectations in its impact on fishing in the Central Basin; and
Whereas, an expansion of the
existing artificial reef systems in
the Western Basin will further concentrate fish within a given area
near shore; and
Whereas, artificial reef expansion
will create permanent habitats for
many fish species by providing
food,
shelter,
protection
and
a
spawning area; and
Whereas, the expansion of near
shore permanent fish habitat will
benefit
the
Cleveland
economy
through non-local anglers’ expenditures of gas, food, bait, tackle and
overnight lodging; and
Whereas, if the proposed settlement between the NFL and the City
of Cleveland is approved, Cleveland
Municipal Stadium will be demolished and a new facility will be
built to house the Cleveland Browns
NFL franchise; and
Whereas, in order to demolish
Municipal
Stadium
lead
and
asbestos abatement of the structure
must be completed prior to demolition; and

28
Whereas, upon demolition of the
structure, a huge quantity of clean
brick and concrete rubble will need
to be transported off site and disposed of; and
Whereas, the brick and concrete
rubble created by the proposed
demolition of Municipal Stadium
would only need to be transported
across the street to the Port of
Cleveland and hauled to a reef site
for use in expansion of the reef system; and
Whereas, the use of the brick and
concrete rubble for expansion of the
artificial reef system will save hundreds of thousands of dollars in the
current demolition budget for the
proposed stadium; and
Whereas, the use of said concrete
and brick rubble to build artificial
reef structures will save scarce
landfill resources and create an
asset at minimal cost which will
survive
for
many
generations
beyond the proposed facility; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that plans for a
new artificial reef to benefit the
Cleveland
area
should
proceed
simultaneously with plans for the
future of Cleveland Municipal Stadium; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Mayor and the Administration to
plan for the utilization of clean
material from the demolition of
Cleveland
Municipal
Stadium
to
expand the Cuyahoga County Commissioners Reef or build new reefs
in order to create the largest freshwater artificial reef system in the
world.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to the Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted September 30, 1996.
Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.
Res. No. 1807-96.
By Councilman Jackson.
An emergency resolution urging
HUD to provide CMHA with the necessary funding to provide traditional public housing replacement housing, or funding to renovate all buildings at Carver Park Estates, or failing the above, to rescind HOPE VI
Plus
funding
for
Carver
Park
Estates.
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
passed Resolution No. 1488-96, on
August 14, 1996, opposing President
Clinton’s and HUD’s policies that
are detrimental to public housing,
subsidized housing, and low income
people; and
Whereas, demolition of public
housing without traditional replacement housing is a policy that is
detrimental to public housing, subsidized housing and low income people; and
Whereas, HOPE VI Plus has as a
major component the demolishing of
public housing; and

The City Record
Whereas, Public Housing Authorities applying for HOPE VI Plus
funding receive better consideration
if demolition is part of their application; and
Whereas, it is almost impossible
to receive HOPE VI Plus funding
without including demolition in the
application; and
Whereas, Carver Park Estates has
been awarded funding under HOPE
VI Plus; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority (“CMHA”)
plans to demolish a substantial
number of public housing units at
Carver Park Estates; and
Whereas, CMHA has 10,000 families on their waiting list; and
Whereas, the Department of Housing
and
Urban
Development
(“HUD”) has eliminated the one-forone replacement requirement; and
Whereas, HUD has not provided
CMHA with funding to provide traditional public housing replacement
housing while CMHA has 10,000
families on their waiting list; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that HUD has
failed to provide funding for traditional public housing replacement
housing
while
encouraging
the
demolition of public housing units
at the same time there are 10,000
families on CMHA’s waiting list;
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1.
That HUD provide
CMHA with the necessary funding
to provide traditional public housing replacement housing.
Section 2. That failing Section 1
of this resolution, then HUD must
provide CMHA with the necessary
funding to renovate all building at
Carver Park Estate.
Section 3. If HUD can or will not
do Section 1 or 2 of this resolution,
then HUD moves to rescind HOPE
VI Plus funding for Carver Park
Estates.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

ownership of a D1, D2, D3 and D3A

Whereas, this Council objected to
the transfer of ownership of a D1,
D2, D3 and D3A Liquor Permit to

1124-96, adopted June 10, 1996; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to

of a municipal department; now,
