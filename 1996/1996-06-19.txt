By Councilmen Coats, Westbrook
and Polensek.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Justice Department to move
swiftly and utilize all available
resources to identify the perpetrators of the recent surge of church
burnings, and urging the U.S. Congress to establish Community Reinvestment Act monies and to establish a source of federal funding
through grants and low interest
loans for rebuilding churches that
were and are burned down by perpetrators of hate crimes.
Whereas, this Council believes
that the burning down of churches
is among the most disgusting and
disgraceful acts that one can commit; and
Whereas, the recent steps being
taken by the majority Congress to
enact laws that ban church burning
through its legislative empowerment are commendable, but serve no
real remedy for worshippers and
communities whose churches have
already been burned to the ground;
and
Whereas,
this
Council
views
church burning as a very serious,
national health and safety crisis, as
innocent lives are threatened each
time a church is set afire; and
Whereas, the recent explosion of
church burnings brings to mind the
burning and bombing of churches in
the 1960s, where 3 innocent little
black girls were killed, where fam-

June 19, 1996
ilies’ dreams were destroyed, and
where communities burst into violence; and
Whereas, it has been well stated
that “without a watchful eye, history will certainly repeat itself”; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that it is paramount that citizens of these United
States feel free to worship without
threat of being killed during worship; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the U.S. Justice Department to move
swiftly and utilize all available
resources to identify the perpetrators of the recent surge of church
burnings.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the U.S. Congress to establish Community Reinvestment Act monies
and to establish a source of federal
funding through grants and low
interest loans for rebuilding churches that were and are burned by perpetrators of hate crimes.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution urging
the Administration to implement
tough enforcement of the City’s curfew laws and to fund additional programs for minors after school and
during the summer.
Whereas, the City’s neighborhoods
continue to experience serious problems from minors wandering the
streets in violation of the City’s curfew laws; and
Whereas, on June 10, 1996, this
Council passed Ordinance No. 183195, which toughens the City’s “nighttime” curfew laws in a manner similar to the City’s “daytime” curfew
laws; and
Whereas, these laws, among other
things, place a duty on parents to
take reasonable steps to insure that
their children are in school and to
prohibit their children from being
on the streets during the curfew
hours; and
Whereas, these laws can only be
effective,
however,
if
they
are
enforced; and
Whereas, with hot summer days
approaching, it is imperative that
the police increase activities to keep
minors off the streets in violation of
the City’s curfew laws; and
Whereas,
the
Administration
should provide additional programs
for minors after school and during
the
summer,
giving
priority
to
neighborhoods that lack existing
programs, in order to provide activities for these minors; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that strict

fund additional programs for minors
after school and during the summer,
giving priority to neighborhoods

receive

this

White, Lewis, Rybka, Westbrook,
Robinson, Johnson and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to enact
a deposit law for glass bottles and
requesting the Council President to
arrange a meeting between the
Cuyahoga County delegates to the
Ohio Assembly and the sponsors of
this legislation.
Whereas, the retail sale of certain
beverages in breakable glass containers which are improperly disposed of when empty has resulted
in such a proliferation of broken
glass in and upon the streets, parks,
and other public grounds of the City
of Cleveland and other major cities
throughout the State of Ohio, as to
render said public grounds dangerous to the citizens and particularly
to the children of this State; and
Whereas, the problem of broken
glass caused by improper disposal
of empty beverage bottles poses a
serious health and safety problem;
and
Whereas, it is virtually impossible
to recycle glass once it is broken
and it is virtually impossible to
remove
all
broken
glass
from
grassy areas in parks and recreational areas; and
Whereas, establishing an incentive or rewards program for the
recycling of glass bottles is one
means available to combat the problem of broken glass littering streets,
sidewalks, parks, and other public
areas of the City, and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
health, safety, and welfare of the
citizens of the State of Ohio; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly to enact
a deposit law for glass bottles.
Section 2. That the President of
Council is requested forthwith to
arrange a meeting between the
Cuyahoga County delegates to the
Ohio General Assembly and various
members of this Council, including
the Council President, the Majority
Leader, the Majority Whip, and the
sponsors of this legislation, concerning the enactment of a deposit
law for glass bottles in the State of
Ohio.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to each of
the Cuyahoga County delegates to
the General Assembly, as well as to
the President of the Ohio Senate and
the Speaker of the Ohio House of
Representatives.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

through 511.12 thereof, relating to hospital trailblazer signs.
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are hereby supplemented by enacting new Section 511.01 through 511.12 thereof, to read respectively, as follows:
CHAPTER 511
HOSPITAL
TRAILBLAZER SIGNS
Section 511.01 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that signs placed in the public right-of-way to direct motorists to
emergency medical facilities are located and designed in a manner which provides information clearly and efficiently, with a minimum of confusion and clutter. Generally, these guidelines are consistent with standards established by the Ohio Department of Transportation.
Section 511.02 Definitions
(a) A “hospital trailblazer sign” is a sign located within the public right-of-way, directing the public to a qualifying hospital facility.
(b) A “standard” hospital trailblazer sign displays only the “H” symbol and a white directional arrow, as depicted in Section 511.12.
(c) A hospital trailblazer “identification” sign displays the name of each hospital to which the public is directed, as depicted in Section 511.12.
Section 511.03 Qualifying Hospital Facilities
Qualifying hospital facilities are hospitals that provide emergency medical services to the general public on a
7 day-a-week, 24 hour-a-day basis, with a physician on duty in the emergency department at all times or with a
registered nurse on duty in the emergency department and with a physician in the hospital on call. Qualifying
hospital facilities are permitted to use hospital trailblazer signs pursuant to this chapter.
Section 511.04 Design of Signs
(a) All Signs. Each hospital trailblazer sign shall consist of a rectangular metal panel 24" in width, displaying a white “H” on a blue background in a 24" square copy area, placed at the top of the sign. The sign shall
also display a directional arrow or arrows. All elements of the sign shall be displayed on a single panel, bordered in a white frame. Each sign shall be designed in accordance with the applicable illustration in Section
511.12. Each hospital may be identified with either a Standard sign or an Identification Sign, as described in
divisions (b) and (c) of this Section.
(b) Standard Signs. The Standard Sign shall be designed according to division (b) of Section 511.02. The sign
panel shall be 24" in width and a total of 33" in height, including a 9" high band for display of the directional arrow.
(c) Identification Signs. The Identification Sign shall display the name or names of each qualifying hospital
permitted to be displayed at the subject location, in accordance with the General Location Standards set forth
in Section 511.05. Each hospital name shall be displayed in white letters at least 3" in height, in a copy area
which is a maximum of 15" in height. A white directional arrow shall be placed under each hospital name. For
signs displaying the names of two or more hospitals, the hospitals shall be listed in descending order with respect
to the distance of each hospital, with the closest hospital listed first. The distance of each hospital’s emergency
entrance shall be displayed in fractions of a mile, in white numerals and letters placed to the left of the directional arrow. No more than three (3) hospital names shall be displayed on a single sign unless a special design
accommodating more than three names has been approved by the City Planning Director for a location at which
the standards of this chapter permit identification of more than three hospitals.
Section 511.05 General Locational Standards
(a) Local Area Signs. The area within one mile of the boundaries of a qualifying hospital facility shall be
considered the “local area” for purposes of hospital trailblazer sign placement. Within the “local area,” trailblazer
signs directing motorists to the subject hospital or hospitals may be placed on arterial roads or collector roads

1194

(as classified by the Ohio Department of Transportation) at “decision-making points” where a right or left turn
is required, and at the intersection of two or more arterial roads. Separate signs for two or more hospitals shall
not be permitted where a single, multiple-hospital sign could be placed.
(b) Signs on Freeway Routes. Outside of the 1-mile “local area,” hospital trailblazer signs shall be permitted
only on roads which provide the most direct route from freeway interchanges most directly serving a qualifying
hospital. Such signs may be placed at “decision-making points,” where a right or left turn is required for one or
more of the listed hospitals, and at the intersection of two or more arterial roads (as classified by Ohio Department of Transportation). Separate signs for two or more hospitals shall not be permitted where a single, multiple-hospital sign could be placed.
(c) Signs on Freeways. Hospital trailblazer signs shall be placed on inter-state highways and other freeways,
as well as in immediate proximity to freeway exits ramps, as permitted by the Ohio Department of Transportation.
Section 511.06 Specific Placement Standards
(a) Distance from Intersection. A permitted hospital trailblazer sign shall be placed approximately 150-200 feet
in advance of an intersection where a left turn is indicated, approximately 100 feet in advance of an intersection where only a right turn is indicated, and less than 100 feet in advance of an intersection where no turn is
indicated. Precise locations for particular signs shall be determined by the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering
and Parking.
(b) Attachment. Hospital trailblazer signs shall be attached to utility poles, where such poles are appropriately located. Only where utility poles or other sign posts are not available shall hospital trailblazer signs be attached
to posts installed exclusively for display of the trailblazer sign. Specific placement shall be approved by the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering and Parking and, for signs placed on utility poles, the Commissioner of Cleveland Public Power.
(c) Vertical and Lateral Clearance. Each hospital trailblazer sign shall be set back at least two (2) feet from
the curb face or as permitted by the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering and Parking. The bottom of each sign
shall be approximately 7-10 feet above the level of the adjoining street surface, as approved by the Commissioner
of Traffic Engineering and Parking.
Section 511.07 Installation, Ownership and Maintenance
(a) Manufacture, installation, maintenance, and replacement of hospital trailblazer signs shall be at the sole
cost and responsibility of the subject hospital or hospitals or its designated agent or agents. The signs shall
remain property of the hospital or hospitals or its agent or agents.
(b) All signs shall be maintained in good condition. Signs in deteriorated or damaged condition, or signs that
contain obsolete information shall be repaired, replaced or removed upon the order of the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering and Parking.

(a) Comprehensive Sign Location Plan. Not later than six (6) months after the effective date of this chapter,
all hospitals shall submit to the City Planning Commission a comprehensive citywide plan for the placement of
such signs. The plan shall indicate the general location of each proposed sign and each existing sign to be
retained, and the name or names of each hospital listed on each sign. The plan shall demonstrate how the number of signs will be minimized by coordinating the signage needs of hospitals that share access routes. The City
Planning Commission shall review the plan with respect to the General Locational Standards set forth in Section
511.05 and shall either approve or disapprove the plan within 45 days of receipt of a complete plan, unless the
applicant hospitals request an extension in this time period to permit preparation of recommended revisions. The
Commission shall consult with the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering and Parking prior to approving the plan.
(b) Encroachment Permit Application. Subsequent to approval of a comprehensive sign location plan by the
City Planning Commission, any hospital or hospitals seeking to install hospital trailblazer signs shall apply for
an Encroachment Permit from the Director of Public Service. The application shall include the following information:
(1) a written description of the proposed encroachment or encroachments, including the dimensions, height, color
and construction materials of each sign, as well as the name or names of each hospital listed on each sign;

refer the Encroachment Permit application to the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering and Parking, the Director of the City Planning Commission and, if applicable, the Commissioner of Cleveland Public Power, each of
whom shall review the application for consistency with the standards established in this chapter, the approved
comprehensive sign location plan, and other applicable City standards. Each such official shall transmit a recommendation to the Director of Public Service, who shall then initiate the final Encroachment Permit process.
The Director shall issue the Encroachment Permit if he or she determines that all requirements of this chapter
have been met, including consent of the City Council member in whose ward the encroachment is to be located.
(d) Revocation of Encroachment Permits. The Director of Public Service shall revoke the Encroachment Permit for any sign that is not maintained in accordance with this chapter.

Planning Commission pursuant to division (a) of Section 511.08, each hospital shall submit a complete listing of
all existing hospital trailblazer signs it installed prior to the effective date of this chapter. The listing shall
include the location of each sign, a notation indicating whether the hospital proposes to retain, remove or replace
each sign, the ordinance number of the applicable Encroachment Permit for each sign, and a photograph of each
sign, or sign type, marked with the dimensions of the sign panel.
(b) Conforming Signs. Any sign determined by the Director of the City Planning Commission to be substantially conforming to these- guidelines shall be permitted to remain in place. However, if there is no record of an
Encroachment Permit for any such sign, the subject hospital shall apply for an Encroachment Permit within 30
days of receipt of written notification from said Director.

after receipt of written notice from said Director, except in the case of a sign which the hospital proposes to
replace. For such signs, the hospital shall submit an Encroachment Permit application for the replacement sign
to the Director of Public Service within 30 days of approval of the Comprehensive Sign Location Plan. The nonconforming sign shall be removed and replaced within 30 days of the issuance of an Encroachment Permit.

various ordinances; and to repeal Section 309.25, as amended by Ordinance No. 86-85, passed February 25, 1985,
all relating to town houses.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are hereby supplemented by enacting new Section 337.031 thereof, to read as follows:
Section 337.031 Townhouse (RA) Districts
(a) Purpose. Townhouse Districts (i.e., Residential Attached districts) are established to provide sites for lowrise development of attached residential units at medium to high densities. Such developments are intended to
serve as a transition between areas of detached residences and areas of higher intensity development or to serve
as a means of clustering housing units on sites which can be developed most appropriately through such clustering.
(b) Definitions. A “townhouse unit” is a single dwelling unit, situated at ground level, served by its own exclusive exterior entrance, and attached to one or more other such units by fire walls or fire separation walls. A
“townhouse building” is a building composed of two or more townhouse units. The terms “townhouse” and “row
house” shall have the same meaning unless otherwise indicated.
(c) Permitted Uses. In a Townhouse District, permitted uses are limited to townhouse buildings and all main
and accessory uses permitted and as regulated in Two-Family Districts. However, notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 355.05 regarding existing lots of record, lots established for development of attached residences shall
not be developed or redeveloped for detached residences unless such lots meet all prevailing regulations applicable to the development of detached residences.
(d) Ownership. Townhouse units may be in condominium ownership, where two or more units are located on
a single lot, or in a type of ownership where each unit is located on a separate lot. Each townhouse development shall conform to the regulations applicable to its form of ownership.
(e) District Establishment. The following Townhouse Districts are hereby established: RA-1, RA-2, and RA-3
(with the abbreviation “RA” indicating “Residential, Attached” and the numerals indicating that the districts are
listed in order of “density,” from lowest to highest).
(f) Site Planning and Design. No Building Permit shall be issued for the original construction of a townhouse
unit or townhouse building without approval of the City Planning Commission, which shall seek to ensure that
the development meets the following standards of site planning and architectural design.
(1) Compatibility. The development shall be visually compatible with nearby properties with respect to such
design elements as scale, height, setback, orientation to existing streets, open spaces, roof lines, architectural
style, materials, colors, and proportions of architectural features. Furthermore, the development shall not adversely affect the use of nearby properties with respect to such factors as pedestrian and vehicular access, privacy,
safety, and obstructions to light and air.
(2) Site Layout. Buildings, structures and landscape features shall be arranged so as to create visual interest,
avoid monotony, maximize privacy, conserve natural features, minimize the need for grading, provide for usable
areas of common and private open space, facilitate efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and promote
security and personal safety.
(3) Building Design. Townhouse units shall be designed so as to create visual interest and differentiate individual units through variations in roof lines, wall setbacks and building materials or through use of porches,
bay windows, and other projecting elements. Garages shall be placed to the rear of the residential units or, if
located in the front of units, shall be designed and placed in a manner which reduces their visual prominence.
(4) Circulation and Parking. Circulation and parking shall be designed in a manner which provides proper
access for service and safety vehicles, minimizes conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles, minimizes the number of curb cuts onto major streets, avoids placing excessive traffic on local residential streets, avoids unenclosed parking in front yards, and avoids placement of garage doors so close to sidewalks as to impair pedestrian safety.
(g) Area and Yard~Regulations. The following yard and area regulations shall apply to townhouse developments in RA-1, RA-2, and RA-3 Districts and in other zoning districts which permit townhouse development. All
figures are minimum requirements unless otherwise stated. The City Planning Commission may require greater

1205

restrictions as necessary to meet the standards of division (f). For main buildings other than townhouses and
for accessory uses and structures, regulations of the Two-Family District shall apply.

served by common parking or common vehicular entrances shall be classified as a “shopping center” and shall
be permitted one (1) free-standing identification sign and one (1) wall identification sign in addition to other
permitted signs and in accordance with the following regulations:
(1) Contents. Each shopping center identification sign shall display only the name of the center and, at the
discretion of the shopping center owner, the name of one (1) business located within the center. In the case of
an enclosed shopping mall, such free-standing sign may display the names of any business located within the
mall and not directly served by an exclusive exterior entrance.
(2) Size. The maximum sign face area of a shopping center identification sign shall equal twenty (20) square
feet for each 10,000 square feet of gross floor area but shall not exceed 125 square feet. All shopping centers,
however, shall be permitted a sign of at least fifty (50) square feet.
(3) Other Regulations. All other regulations of this chapter applicable to identification signs shall apply to a
shopping center identification sign.
(4) Other Signs. A lot displaying a shopping center identification sign may display no other free-standing identification or business signs.
(5) Secondary Frontage. One (1) additional shopping center identification free-standing sign and one (1) additional shopping center identification wall sign shall be permitted on a secondary street frontage with a vehicular entrance to the shopping center.
(6) Outlets. If a vehicular entrance or parking lot of a shopping center also serves a use located on a separate lot (i.e., “out lot”), the free-standing identification or business sign permitted for such lot shall be limited
to a maximum of twenty-five (25) square feet in area and seven (7) feet in height.
(e) Gasoline Service Stations. Signs for gasoline service stations shall conform with all regulations of this
chapter except for the maximum sign area regulations of division (a) of Section 350.14 and any regulations which
directly conflict with the regulations stated below:
(1) Free-standing Business Sign. Each station shall be permitted one (1) permanent free-standing business
signs, with total sign face area of the panel or panels not exceeding one hundred (100) square feet. Such sign
shall be limited to identifying the company name, management, fuel prices, and services offered.
(2) Signs at Service Islands. Stations shall be permitted information signs at fuel or other service islands which
display information regarding type of service or are necessary in directing or instructing the motorist who has
entered the station area. Signs not extending beyond the edges of fuel pumps are permitted and shall not be
counted as business identification signs.
(3) Wall and Canopy Signs. Each station shall be permitted permanent identifications, business, directional and
information signs displayed as wall or canopy signs and not exceeding one hundred (100) square feet in combined area. Non-opaque internally-illuminated canopy surfaces (“fascia”) shall be considered as sign panels for
purposes of sign area measurement.
(4) Temporary Signs. Temporary signs shall be permitted in accordance with the regulations of Section 350.12.
(f) Drive-Through Restaurants. For restaurants providing direct service to customers in motor vehicles, one (1)
free-standing or wall-mounted “menu board” sign (limited to information regarding the restaurant’s menu and
related instructions) shall be permitted for each drive-through lane in addition to signs and sign area otherwise
permitted. Such sign shall not exceed forty (40) square feet in area and six (6) feet in height and shall meet
setback regulations applicable to free-standing identification signs (as specified in division (c) of this section).
(g) Regulations for Larger Projecting Signs. A projecting sign may exceed the otherwise maximum permitted
size of twelve (12) square feet and the otherwise maximum permitted projection of four (4) feet from a building wall if such sign meets the following standards:
(1) Such sign shall be set back from the closest interior side lot line and the closest tenant party wall line
at least one (1) foot for each one (1) square foot of sign area.
(2) Such sign shall in no case exceed thirty-six (36) square feet in area nor eight (8) feet in projection from
the building wall and shall be set back at least two (2) feet from the outer edge of any street curb.
(3) No Building Permit shall be issued for such sign without approval of the City Planning Commission, which
shall consider the design quality of the sign and its compatibility with the design character of the subject property and surrounding properties. In addition to considering such general design factors as placement, proportions,
color, materials, and consistency with signs to be seen as a series, the City Planning Commission may specifically require use of non-rectangular, custom-shaped panels, exposed neon or reflected lighting, unobtrusive support structures, narrow-profile sign cabinets, or other design features necessary to ensure that a larger projecting sign will enhance the appearance of the building on which it is placed and the district in which it is located.
(4) At least five (5) working days prior to the City Planning Commission meeting at which approval under
the regulations of this division will be considered, written notice shall be provided to the City Council member
in whose ward the proposed sign is to be located.

An emergency ordinance to amend
Sections 179.01, 179.03, 179.04, 179.09
and 179.11 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1748-80,
passed October 8, 1980, to amend Section 179.10, of the Codified Ordinances
of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by Ordinance No. 1398-83, passed
may 16, 1983, to amend Section
179.12 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended
by Ordinance No. 1111-83, passed
May 6, 1983, and to amend sections
1, 6, 9, and 17 of Ordinance No. 174980, passed October 8, 1980, all relating to the City’s covenants under its
general bond ordinance; appointing
a successor trustee under the general bond ordinance; and authorizing and approving related matters.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 1748-80, passed by the Council of
the City of Cleveland on October 8,
1980, as amended by Ordinance No.

1229

99
1111-83, passed May 6, 1983, and
Ordinance No. 1398-83, passed May
16, 1983, the City amended Sections
179.01 through 179.18 of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
to provide that the City escrow its
bond retirement fund (the “Sinking
Fund”) with the Escrow Agent
(defined therein) to help restore the
confidence of investors in the creditworthiness of the City, to establish
a Reserve Account (as defined
therein), to require that it be maintained at an amount equal to fifteen
percent of the highest aggregate
annual debt charges on all City
voted and unvoted general obligation bonds and notes payable in any
subsequent year, and to provide that
moneys held therein shall be used
for the payment of debt charges to
the extent that moneys available in
other accounts in the Sinking Fund
are insufficient for such purposes;
and
Whereas, the City’s financial management
and
practices
have
improved and the confidence of
investors in the creditworthiness of
the City has been restored to the
extent that the maintenance and
funding of the Reserve Account in
the Sinking Fund is no longer necessary to enable the City to issue
general obligation debt under favorable terms to the City; and
Whereas, it is therefore desirable
to amend various sections of Chapter 179 of the Codified Ordinances
of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, to eliminate the Reserve Account in the
Sinking Fund and the requirement
that the Reserve Account be funded; and
Whereas, the City covenanted in
Ordinance No. 1749-80, passed October 8, 1980, as amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83, passed May 6,
1983 (the “General Bond Ordinance”)
to maintain the moneys and investments in the Sinking Fund in trust
with the Escrow Agent and to provide for deposits to the accounts in
the Sinking Fund; and
Whereas, Section 14 of the General Bond Ordinance provides that the
City and the Trustee (as defined
therein)
may
execute
amending
ordinances amending the General
Bond Ordinance, subject in the case
of
certain
amendments
to
the
receipt of the consent of not less
than 66-2/3% of the holders of outstanding general obligation bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance; and
Whereas, the original purchasers
of the City’s outstanding general
obligation bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance in 1993 and
1994, as a condition of their purchase of those bonds and on behalf
of all subsequent holders of those
bonds, consented to the amendments
contained herein to eliminate the
Reserve Account and the requirement that the Reserve Account be
funded and maintained, the City
intends to obtain the consent to
those amendments from the original
purchasers of the City’s general
obligation bonds to be issued under
the General Bond Ordinance in 1996
and, upon receipt of the consents of
those 1996 bondholders, the consents
of the holders of not less than 662/3% of outstanding general obligation bonds issued under the General Bond Ordinance will have been
obtained; and
Whereas,
it
is
necessary
to
appoint a successor trustee under
the General Bond Ordinance to
replace Society National Bank (the
successor to Morgan Guaranty Trust

100
Company of New York, the original
trustee) because Society National
Bank has sold substantially all of
its corporate trust operations, and it
is necessary and desirable to make
certain amendments to the General
Bond Ordinance that do not require
the consent of bondholders to cure
certain inconsistencies in the General Bond Ordinance resulting from
the change in the bank serving as
Trustee and paying agent; and
Whereas, it is necessary that this
Ordinance become effective immediately in order that the City may
promptly proceed in 1996 with the
issuance of bonds under the General Bond Ordinance and proceed to
implement the amendments to effect
the elimination of the Reserve
Account in order to achieve more
efficiency in its financial management, and as a result, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety, and for
the usual, daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland that:

Section 9. Supplementary Debt Service Moneys.
(a) Covenant. Subject to the provisions of subsection (g) hereof, the
City hereby covenants that, so long
as any of the Bonds are outstanding, it will collect, appropriate and
deposit to the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund held by the Escrow
Agent, for the payment of debt
charges payable from such account,
municipal income taxes and other
taxes, receipts, and available revenues sufficient in amount and time
of receipt to meet such debt charges
as provided in this section.
(b) Schedules of Payments. Such
amount of municipal income taxes
shall be determined annually and
adjusted periodically as follows:
With each tax budget, the City shall
set forth a schedule, on a monthly
basis for the full budget year, of the
year-end balances and the tax and
other receipts to be credited to the
various accounts of the Sinking
Fund, other than from the income
tax, and the times and amounts of
payments
from
the
respective
accounts of the Sinking Fund to
meet the required debt charges
payable from such accounts. For
such tax budget purpose, such tax
and other receipts planned to be
credited to the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account shall be
limited to the ad valorem tax levy
within the ten-mill limitation, special assessments levied for debt
charges on unvoted general obligations, accrued interest and premium,
if any, received upon the sale of
unvoted general obligations, reason-

The City Record
ably estimated interest income properly to be credited to the Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations Account,
including interest from investment
of moneys held to the credit of such
account. To the extent of any deficiency in time or amount of such
revenue receipts to be credited to
the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the Sinking Fund
to meet debt charges payable from
such account there shall be set forth
in such schedule of monthly payments from the income tax receipts,
in equal monthly amounts from the
first month of the year, sufficient to
meet such deficiency, to wit: As to
the first debt charges payment date
for which a deficiency is determined
(by
taking
into
account
only
receipts to be credited to such
account from the above-described
sources, other than the income
taxes, through the last calendar
month preceding such debt charges
payment date), the schedule shall
provide for payments from the
income tax receipts to such account
in each month from the first month
of the year to the month preceding
that
in
which
such
first
debt
charges payment date occurs, inclusive, of monthly amounts equal to
such deficiency divided by the number of such months of the year preceding the month in which such
debt charges payment date occurs;
for each subsequent debt charges
payment date any such deficiency
shall be determined on the basis of
such other receipts to be credited to
the account through the last full
calendar month preceding such date
after
deducting
debt
charges
payable from the account prior to
such date, and the schedule shall
provide for payments from the
income tax receipts to such account
in each month from the first month
of the year to the month preceding
that in which such debt charges
payment date occurs, inclusive, in
monthly amounts equal to such deficiency divided by the number of
such months of the year preceding
the month in which such debt
charges payment date occurs; so
that the total amount so scheduled
to be deposited to such account from
income tax receipts in any month
shall be the aggregate of the respective equal monthly amounts determined with respect to each such
debt service payment date. Such
schedule, certified by the Director of
Finance of the City, shall be delivered by the City to the Trustee a
reasonable time before the tax budget is adopted by the City. Such
schedule
and
certification
and
revised schedules certified under
this paragraph shall be accompanied by a report prepared by the
independent
accounting
firm
engaged pursuant to paragraph (c)
of Section 10 of this Ordinance stating, and showing financial data sufficient to demonstrate, that the total
amount to be deposited to the Unvoted
Tax
Supported
Obligations
Account from income tax receipts in
any month as set forth in such
schedule is consistent with the
requirements of paragraph (b) of
this Section, and that the making of
such deposits can reasonably be
expected to result in there being
amounts in the Account sufficient to
make timely payment of all debt
charges scheduled to be paid from
such Account during such budget
year. The City shall provide to the
Trustee all information required by
the Trustee with respect to such
schedule or revised schedule, includ-

1233

103
ing designation of the amounts from
specified sources to be deposited to
the credit of the respective accounts
of the Sinking Fund. The City shall
also cause a certified copy of the
schedule to be submitted to the Central Collection Agency (Income Tax
Administrator of the City) or other
entity or officer having charge of
collection of the City’s income taxes
at the time (the “Agency”, which
term, where appropriate, includes
the
Central
Collection
General
Account, or any other fund or
account in or to the credit of which
income tax receipts allocable to the
City are first held upon collection
and prior to distribution to other
funds or accounts of the City; and
also includes any agency which is
independent of the City hereafter
authorized to collect the City’s
income taxes, for which purpose the
City hereby covenants that in so
authorizing such collection by such
agency the City shall require the
agreement of such agency, for the
benefit of the Bondholders, to comply with the applicable provisions of
this Ordinance pertaining to the
Agency). The tax budget of the City
and its appropriation ordinances
shall be consistent with such certified schedule. The City shall monitor continuously all estimates and
actual receipts of the amounts from
the respective sources to be deposited to the respective accounts of the
Sinking Fund. If at any time the
projected or actual amount of the
receipts in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account from
sources other than income taxes is
less than the amount budgeted from
such
sources
or
the
projected
amount required to be paid from
such account will be greater than
estimated in such schedule, the
Director of Finance shall certify a
revised
schedule
of
increased
deposits from the income tax, based
on a projection of the same proportional deficiency from such other
sources for the ensuing months of
the fiscal year or such greater deficiency from such sources as the circumstances indicate to the Director
of Finance and projection of such
revised requirements, such that the
increased deposits from the income
tax will be sufficient to meet such
projected deficiencies and requirements. The Director of Finance
shall certify such revised schedule
of deposits from the income tax to
the Trustee and to the Agency. If
the deposits from said sources other
than from the income tax shall for
at least three consecutive months
thereafter
achieve
the
budgeted
amount and amounts of any additional requirements not anticipated
in the budget, the Director of
Finance
may
again
revise
the
schedule for deposits of income
taxes consistent with the original
schedule and similarly certify to the
Trustee (with supporting information) and to the Agency. At any
time that deposits to the Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations Account
from sources other than the income
tax have exceeded the amounts
scheduled therefrom for three consecutive months, the Director of
Finance
may
certify
a
revised
schedule of deposits thereto from
the income tax to the Trustee and
to the Agency. Such schedule may
also be revised at any time, in a
manner consistent with the objective of this section, upon the concurrence of the Director of Finance
and the Trustee and certification of
the revised schedule by the Director

104
of Finance to the Trustee and to the
Agency.
(c) Withholding and Payment.
Commencing with the first day of
each month during which a deposit
from the income tax receipts is to
be made to the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund in accordance with
the schedule last certified by the
Director of Finance to the Trustee
and to the Agency (the “Effective
Schedule”), there shall be withheld
in the Agency, from the first and
ensuing collections of income taxes
allocable to the City the full amount
to be so deposited in such month
and there shall not be paid over
from the Agency to any other City
fund any amount from income tax
receipts allocable to the City until
the amounts of income tax receipts
set forth in the Effective Schedule
for that month has been reserved
and paid over directly from the
Agency to the Escrow Agent and
receipt thereof has been acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. Such
amount shall be paid over to the
Escrow Agent in the most expeditious manner practical as may be
arranged among the Director of
Finance,
the
Agency
and
the
Escrow Agent. In any event, those
officers of the City having the
authority to act in the matter (currently,
the
Commissioner
of
Accounts, Treasurer and Income
Tax Administrator of the City) shall
take all such actions as are necessary or appropriate to make prompt
payments of income tax receipts
directly to the Escrow Agent as provided for in this Section.
(d) Sufficiency Assured. In any
event, if at any time the Escrow
Agent or the Trustee notifies the
Director of Finance and the Agency
that amounts held by the Escrow
Agent and projected to be deposited
to the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account will be insufficient
to meet the ensuing payments of
debt charges to be paid therefrom
and the amounts of such deficiency,
the City shall, in the manner provided in paragraph (c) of this section, promptly transfer from income
tax receipts allocable to the City
then held by the Agency, and from
the first such receipts following
such certification, to the Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations Account,
the amounts of such deficiency
before making any further distribution therefrom to the City.
(e) Pledge and Covenant to Maintain Income Tax. So long as the
Bonds are outstanding, the City
hereby
pledges
the
municipal
income taxes of the City and grants
a first lien thereon, to the full
extent
required
to
meet
debt
charges payable from the Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations Account
in accordance with this Ordinance
and Chapter 179, to secure the payment of the debt charges on the
Bonds,
on
a
parity
with

The City Record
City covenants to appropriate annually sufficient amounts from the
income taxes for such purpose. The
City further covenants that so long
as any of the Bonds are outstanding, the City shall not repeal or
amend any ordinance for the levy or
collection of its income taxes in any
manner or to such extent that the
City would not be able to meet its
obligations to the holders of the
Bonds under this Section, and any
attempt to do so in any manner
shall be void and of no effect.
(f) Appropriations; Superseding
Effect. The City further covenants
that all income taxes and other
taxes, receipts, and available revenues to be deposited with the
Escrow Agent to the credit of the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund in
accordance
with
this
Ordinance
shall be deemed to be appropriated
to such accounts and shall not be
available for or appropriated to any
other purpose, and that any appropriation ordinance or transfer ordinance or order inconsistent with
this covenant shall not be or be
deemed to be effective to authorize
application of such income tax revenues to other purposes to the
extent inconsistent herewith. Each
officer of the City having authority
to make contracts or expenditures is
hereby directed to give full effect to
this covenant of the City, and the
Director of Finance is hereby directed not to, and shall not, certify
availability of funds for any other
purpose
inconsistent
with
this
covenant. In order to avoid violation
of this covenant, the City further
hereby covenants to adopt and
promptly to amend its appropriation
ordinances to such extent as may be
proper
to
reflect
the
Effective
Schedule under (b) of this section
and the latest certifications of the
Escrow Agent or Trustee under
paragraph (e) of this section. The
provisions of this section shall prevail over and supersede any ordinance or codified ordinance of the
City heretofore or hereafter adopted
to any extent that such ordinance is
inconsistent with this section.
(g) The amount of municipal
income taxes required to be collected,
appropriated,
deposited,
and
pledged and as to which a first lien
is granted pursuant to this Section
9 shall not exceed Two Million Five
Hundred
Thousand
Dollars
($2,500,000) in any year, reduced in
any year after 1983 by the amount
by which the shortfall in such subsequent year is less than the shortfall in 1983 (the “Ceiling”); provided, however, that:
(i) If, after the issuance of all the
Bonds pursuant to the Agreement,
the
City,
subject
to
Council
approval, issues additional unvoted
general obligation bonds or notes in
anticipation of such bonds, or if any
amount of debt charges on Self-Supporting Obligations of the City
heretofore issued and outstanding
on the effective date of this Ordinance or on the Bonds issued pursuant to Ordinance Nos. 1751-80 or
1755-80, adopted by this Council on
the date of adoption of this Ordinance, are not covered by Self-Supporting
Revenues
and
become
payable from the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund pursuant to Chapter
179, and if, after such issuance or
such debt charges become payable
from said Account, such amount of
municipal income taxes, as determined in accordance with subsec-

1234

June 19, 1996
tions (b) and (e) hereof, exceeds
the ceiling, then such amount of
municipal income taxes to be collected, appropriated, deposited and
pledged pursuant to this Section 9
shall be the amount so determined;
(ii) If, while the ceiling is in
effect, the amount of such municipal income taxes, as determined in
accordance with subsections (b) and
(e) hereof, exceeds such limit, then
the City shall set forth in the schedule required under Subsection 9(b)
hereof the source and amount of
other additional available revenues
(subject to application of local government fund receipts to make
deposits for the payment of debt
charges on notes hereafter issued
under Section 118.17 of the Revised
Code of Ohio) to be credited and
deposited to the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account in addition to the tax and other receipts,
including an amount of municipal
income tax receipts not less than
the ceiling, otherwise to be credited
to that account under Subsection
9(b) hereof, and such other additional available revenues shall be
included in determining the sufficiency of the total amount to be
credited to said Account, and, as the
case may be, the City shall likewise
make deposits from such available
revenues at the times and in the
amounts to satisfy subsection (e) of
this Section 9;
(iii) Nothing in this subsection
(g) shall be deemed to prohibit the
City, in its discretion, from appropriating
and
depositing
to
the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account any additional amount of
municipal income taxes.
For purposes of this Subsection
(g), the amount by which the shortfall in any subsequent year is less
than the shortfall in 1983 shall be
determined by calculating the difference
between
the
remainder
(whether negative or positive) in
1983 and in such subsequent year
after subtracting the debt charges
on all Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations from the proceeds of the
unvoted ad valorem property taxes
levied for such debt charges in the
applicable year, based upon budget
estimates to be subsequently adjusted to actual figures.
Section 17. Concerning the Paying
Agents. Except as otherwise provided in the particular Series Bond
Ordinance for the issuance and sale
thereof: the principal of, and the
interest and any premium on, Bonds
shall be payable at the Paying
Agents, which shall be the bank or
trust companies then serving as
Trustee and Escrow Agent, respectively, and interest on fully registered Bonds shall be paid by check
or draft issued by the Escrow Agent
and drawn upon the Sinking Fund.
The City shall provide to the
Escrow Agent a copy of the Bond
registry for such purpose. Pursuant
to Section 179.10 of Chapter 179, the
Escrow Agent shall, at the times
and in the amounts required by the
several
Series
Bond
Ordinances,
make disbursements from the appropriate Sinking Fund accounts to the
Paying Agent responsible for the
payment of Bond service charges on
the Bonds.
(a) Nonpresentment of Bonds or
Coupons. In the event any Bond
shall not be presented for payment
when the principal thereof becomes
due, either at maturity, at the date
fixed for redemption thereof, or otherwise, or in the event any coupon
shall not be presented for payment

June 19, 1996
at the due date thereof. If funds sufficient to pay such Bond or coupon
shall have been made available to
the Paying Agents for the benefit
of the holder or holders thereof, all
liability of the City to the holder
thereof for the payment of such
Bond or coupon, as the case may be,
shall thereupon cease and be completely discharged, and it shall be
the duty of the Paying Agents to
hold such funds, without liability
for interest thereon, in a separate
account for the benefit of the holder of such Bond, or the holder of
such coupon, as the case may be,
who shall thereafter be restricted
exclusively to such funds for any
claim of whatever nature on his
part under this Ordinance or on, or
with
respect
to,
said
Bond
or
coupon; provided that any funds
which shall be so held by the Paying
Agents
and
which
remain
unclaimed by the holder of the Bond
or coupon not presented for payment
for a period of two years after such
due date thereof, shall upon request
in writing by the City be returned
by the Paying Agent to the City for
credit to the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account in the Sinking Fund free of any special claim
of such holder and thereafter the
holder of such Bond or coupon shall
look only to the City for payment
without any interest thereon, and
the Paying Agents shall have no
further responsibility with respect
to such moneys.
(b) Funds to be Held in Trust. All
moneys required or permitted to be
deposited with or paid to the Paying Agents under any provision of
this Ordinance and any investments
thereof, shall be held by the Paying
Agents in trust and, except for moneys deposited with or paid to the
Paying Agents for the redemption
of Bonds, notice of the redemption
of which has been duly given, and
moneys held by the Paying Agents
pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof,
shall, while held by the Paying
Agents, be subject to the lien hereof.
(c) Appointment of Successor Paying Agent. In case a Paying Agent
shall resign or be dissolved, or otherwise become incapable of acting
hereunder, or in case it shall be
taken under the control of any public officer or officers, or of a receiver appointed by a court, a successor
shall be appointed by the City.
Every such successor Paying Agent
appointed pursuant to the provisions
of this Section shall be a corporate
trust company or bank or banking
association in good standing and
willing to accept the position under
the terms and conditions of this
Ordinance.
A
successor
Paying
Agent must also be the successor
Paying Agent under each Series
Bond Ordinance authorizing each
issue of Bonds sold under the Agreement. The City shall publish notice
of the appointment of such successor Paying Agent in the manner
provided for publication of notice of
call for redemption of bonds in Section 4 hereof.
(d) Dealing in Bonds. A Paying
Agent, and any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, may in
good faith, become the owners of
Bonds and coupons appertaining
thereto issued pursuant to this Ordinance with the same rights which
they would have hereunder if the
Paying Agent were not such.
Section 4. Appointment of Successor Trustee. The City hereby deter-

The City Record
mines that Society National Bank is
no longer capable of acting as
Trustee under the General Bond
Ordinance, or as registrar, authenticating agent or Paying Agent for
